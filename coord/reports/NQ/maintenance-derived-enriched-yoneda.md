# Maintenance: derived enriched Yoneda stage-2 scheduling

The repeated NQ stage-2 blocks were caused by omitted statement dependencies.
`lem-coef-derived-enriched-yoneda` names the enhanced localization of right dg
modules and derived dg functor/transformation categories in its statement.
The existing owning nodes `lem-coef-dg-module-projective-resolution` and
`lem-coef-dg-quasifunctor-invariance` were listed only in `proof_deps`; neither
has a usable Lean declaration. The bottom-up queue consequently offered this
consumer before its required interfaces were stated.

Maintenance adds both existing nodes to `stmt_deps`, preserving `proof_deps`,
the statement, proof, source, and reviews. The complete dependency-edge set is
unchanged, so this classification correction cannot introduce a new cycle.
The authoritative DAG is `/home/ubuntu/weil-conjectures-sheaf/dag/nodes`, as
configured by the side project's `SHEAF_DAG`; the same edit is applied to the
side snapshot so synchronization and workers agree. Both edits are committed
under their repository's merge lock, with sibling `.maint-NQ-1792141173.bak`
backups. No Lean file, compiler setting, tool, brief or retry limit is changed.

Normal synchronization retired the premature NQ claim at 2026-10-16 17:06:44
server time, before a manual release was needed. This is queue eligibility,
not giving up because of the failure count. The existing prerequisite delivery
branch is preserved. The target can become stage-2 eligible again when reached
from an active target route, after both prerequisite interfaces are stated and
their own statement dependencies are grounded.

During validation, an independent launcher update changed reach traversal to
stop at unsplit nodes (`130d1d3a84` in the side project). The current target route
therefore also stops above this consumer. The original/corrected eligibility
comparison and both-interface future-resumption simulation passed before that
update. The metadata correction remains needed when this route is reopened.
No runtime failure counter, give-up list, or dispatcher process was edited.

Next worker: use the current node and the prerequisite declarations/imports
when the queue offers it again. Do not duplicate these foundations or replace
enhanced mapping complexes/coherent transformations by ordinary homotopy
categories. The retained NQ sandbox has searches and a diagnostic report but
no faithful target Lean module. The first historical run incorrectly treated
the stage-1 NE merge as completion of the stage-2 task; later workers correctly
diagnosed the missing interfaces. A stage-1 delivery is not a Lean statement.

Validation uses the production `dag_queue.Dag.stage2()` on old and corrected
records and checks eventual eligibility with simulated prerequisite
declarations in memory only. No mathematical construction or theorem is
supplied by maintenance. No Lean compilation is needed for JSON-only edits.
Full operational evidence and final commit ids are in the launcher's
`maint/NQ-lem-coef-derived-enriched-yoneda-1792141173/REPORT.md`.
