# derivedExtendScalarsSubfield, derivedExtendScalarsToPadicAlgCl, derivedExtendScalarsCompIso

## Reason

Put the canonical coefficient data below TwoColimit so the coefficient-presentation statement can
refer to the actual tensor comparison without an import cycle. The cached functor and Hom-equivalence
definitions also prevent repeated expansion of resolution and localization data during elaboration.
The old public names remain abbreviations, with exactly the old signatures and definitionally equal
values. No target statement or mathematical definition changes meaning; no target review is reopened
for a semantic change. The independent reader should verify the extraction and definitional equality.

The implementation is in Sheaf.AlgebraicGeometry.CondensedDerivedTensorComparison. It is the verbatim
old tensor-comparison body and the existing generic extension/restriction constructions.

The source command tools/downstream.py, run separately with --uses for all three names, lists these
direct users. No other module is edited.
