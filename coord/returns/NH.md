L: independent stage-2 immutable head e5561d1610ee: the dependency node def-pc-kflat-complex: its `lean` changed on newtargets-dag since the delivery's base ({"module": "Sheaf.Algebra.Homology.KFlat", "declaration": "CochainComplex.IsKFlat", "file": "lean/Sheaf/Algebra/Homology/KFlat.lean", "statement": "def IsKFlat (K : CochainComplex (SheafOfModules.{w} ); the reviewer decides and the group re-pushes

Launcher: Sheaf.Algebra.Homology.KFlat now provides IsKFlat, IsKFlatResolution, and the independent-coefficient predicates; import it instead of changing it.

## lem-exc-proetale-cartesian-open-injective-acyclic (dedicated repair handoff)

The previous worker ended with: re-split (decision of the human, 2026-10-17): step 2 (3129 characters) is not elementary and hides lemmas; make each hidden argument a node of its own that the step cites; keep the statement unchanged

Compiler messages and attribution:
re-split (decision of the human, 2026-10-17): step 2 (3129 characters) is not elementary and hides lemmas; make each hidden argument a node of its own that the step cites; keep the statement unchanged. Start from the existing proof text of this node (it stays in the node file): keep its route and its other steps, and replace each long step by short steps that cite new nodes (or existing nodes/Mathlib leaves) for the arguments it now carries inline. The node's statement and its Lean record stay as they are (its stage-2 Lean statement remains valid, since the statement does not change); the new nodes go through stage 2 as usual. The stage-1 review rejects a non-elementary step longer than 2000 characters.

## lem-zl-bertini-independent-functions (2026-10-17 19:35 UTC, branch head e6ce72aa48)

L: independent stage-2 immutable head e6ce72aa48b7: Head e6ce72aa48b7 is a stage-1 split (commit 'Split lem-zl-bertini-independent-functions'; base node was unsplit with no proof), not a stage-2 statement delivery. H1: no .lean module, no lean record on the item, no '## Worker report' (stage-1 '# Worker report' heading) and no '## Second reading by NH'; the report says no Lean file was written or compiled. H2: item changed in status/proof/proof_deps/proof_origin/created/split_report, and stmt_deps grew by two statement nodes. H12: the new nodes lem-zl-bertini-fibre-dimension-bound and lem-zl-bertini-closed-point-component are unsplit statement nodes with no module. H11: no second reading. A: the report lists citations.json, which is not in the commit. The split's mathematics matches Stacks 0G4E (statement and steps 1-5; dropping 'in no other component' is harmless), but it belongs in stage-1 review. Nothing to compile. Correction: route the split through stage 1; then deliver stage 2 as one commit with a lean/Sheaf module stating 0G4E with sorry, source/blueprint/proof-step docstrings, a lean record with verbatim statement, '## Worker report' and '## Second reading by NH', and a clean per-file compile.

## lem-coef-finite-exceptional (2026-10-19 16:06 UTC, branch head 490c38d86e)

L: independent stage-2 immutable head 490c38d86e7e: RETURN H3 + H13. Compiled clean (nt_compile --json, 5.4 s, no errors or warnings). H3: clause 1 of finite_exceptional is `Nonempty (G ⋙ ι ≅ ι ⋙ H)`, but the node says canonical natural isomorphism Rf^!L ≅ D_X f^* D_Y L. Proof steps 3-4 fix it: trace transpose τ_r, exchange E from projection, ordinary counit and evaluation, absolute-trace-exchange adjunction, uniqueness of right adjoints. The citer lem-coef-finite-adjunction-diagram-realization needs that evaluation transpose, and the integral sibling CoefDualFormulaScalarTranspose pins it with FormulaNormalized. Correction: give a specified dualFormulaIso, either via rightAdjointUniq from absoluteTraceExchangeHomEquiv or via an ∃! evaluation/trace normalization (finite analogue of FormulaNormalized/trace_existsUnique), and assert the clause about it. H13: the delivered def-weil-finite-tor-amplitude record replaces NW's landed record (FiniteTorAmplitudeSites/finiteTorConstructibleEtale, used by at least 10 live modules; 130 recorded nodes cite this dependency) with FiniteTorAmplitude/finiteTorConstructible and drops finiteTorConstructibleEtale. Correction: a superset record on a module that publicly imports both, or leave the record unchanged and explain in the item's lean.note. Correct as delivered: hypotheses, r = n+1 indexing, edge cases, universes; q (canonical comparison, fixed before IsIso); the ∃!-normalized adjunction; b = mateEquiv of q.inv with IsIso; quotient cocycle; b_{r,r} = id via selfReduction; unit and counit identities; docstrings; sorry-only proofs. The generated check file lacking a `module` header is a launcher fault, not a delivery fault.
