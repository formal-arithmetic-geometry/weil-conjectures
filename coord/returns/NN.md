## def-weil-exceptional-adjoint-admissibility (dedicated repair handoff)

The previous worker ended with: The literature re-review (2026-10-16) returned this split. Keep the route; fix exactly the finding below and re-deliver.

Compiler messages and attribution:
E4/C4: The displayed restriction comparison U_{phi,X}F_A ≅ F_BU_{phi,Y} is not composable for U_phi:D(B)→D(A), and is not the statement of lem-sf-compact-support-restriction-of-scalars. Replace it by F_A U_{phi,X} ≅ U_{phi,Y}F_B (or its inverse), and form alpha and its mate from that typed comparison. B3: remove unused statement dependencies def-weil-integral-derived-reduction, lem-weil-integral-scalar-extension-well-defined and def-weil-ambient-exceptional-adjoint unless the definition actually invokes their additional data.

Start from the existing proof text of this node (it stays in the node file): keep its route and its other steps, and replace each long step by short steps that cite new nodes (or existing nodes/Mathlib leaves) for the arguments it now carries inline. The node's statement and its Lean record stay as they are (its stage-2 Lean statement remains valid, since the statement does not change); the new nodes go through stage 2 as usual. The stage-1 review rejects a non-elementary step longer than 2000 characters.

## lem-sbc-ambient-operations-scalar-linearity (2026-10-21 08:19 UTC, branch head 53cc9686e4b)

Superseded again (A6/A7/B10; brief-stage1 l.103 'live finished nodes win; never split one'). This is a re-push of c27a08bf, which was RETURNed as superseded at 07:42 UTC. Both new nodes (lem-sbc-underived-ringed-operations-linear, lem-sbc-linear-right-adjoint) are sha256-identical to that delivery. The item differs from it only in split_report and in reviewed_proof, which was copied from live; the three proof steps are word-for-word the same. The report says a later human instruction overrides the rule even when the item is split and reviewed. Nothing on disk supports this. The only repair note (clones/live and side-live) has mtime 06:08:38 UTC, before J3's stage-3 landing at 06:13 UTC (ledger l.20365, landing 20261021T061336-L-1761747). No HUMAN.md mentions this item. The live node has reviewed_proof.sorry_after [], and the live ProEtaleAmbientOperationsScalarLinearity.lean has 0 sorry. I read proEtaleRingDerivedOperations_scalarLinearity (l.77-137) in full. Its `have` block for linearity of the module direct image (via hc), together with left_adjoint_linear, already proves the underived node. right_adjoint_linear and Mathlib right_adjoint_additive prove the generic node. Landing this split would therefore create spurious open work on a Lean-closed item. The mathematics is sound and I read it in full. The statement is unchanged. Step 1: the sectionwise rho condition is the A-compatibility of c. Step 2: lem-cbc-exact-linear-derived-functor applies to the exact termwise P, with the derived structures of lem-weil-linear-abelian-derived-category. Step 3: the counit-bijection argument is valid for unbounded complexes. Both new nodes are true, and the edge cases u=id with nontrivial c, A=0, a=0/1 and non-injective a_T all hold. Sources are Stacks 03D3/03D6/04TT/09MK, with no SGA. I found no duplicates. Maintainer: retire the stale 06:08Z re-split note for this item.
