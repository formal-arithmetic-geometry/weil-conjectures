Compiler messages and attribution:
E4/C4: The displayed restriction comparison U_{phi,X}F_A ≅ F_BU_{phi,Y} is not composable for U_phi:D(B)→D(A), and is not the statement of lem-sf-compact-support-restriction-of-scalars. Replace it by F_A U_{phi,X} ≅ U_{phi,Y}F_B (or its inverse), and form alpha and its mate from that typed comparison. B3: remove unused statement dependencies def-weil-integral-derived-reduction, lem-weil-integral-scalar-extension-well-defined and def-weil-ambient-exceptional-adjoint unless the definition actually invokes their additional data.

Start from the existing proof text of this node (it stays in the node file): keep its route and its other steps, and replace each long step by short steps that cite new nodes (or existing nodes/Mathlib leaves) for the arguments it now carries inline. The node's statement and its Lean record stay as they are (its stage-2 Lean statement remains valid, since the statement does not change); the new nodes go through stage 2 as usual. The stage-1 review rejects a non-elementary step longer than 2000 characters.

## lem-fd-convolution-kernel (2026-10-18 01:09 UTC, branch head b648c9e43b)

L: independent stage-2 immutable head b648c9e43b8e: Sheaf.Paper.FourierConvolutionKernel declares names that other modules already declare:
  WeilConjectures.fourierConvolutionGeometry: also in Sheaf.Paper.FourierKernelConvolution

Import and reuse the existing declaration. Renaming yours only hides the collision and leaves the same fact proved twice; rename only when the two declarations say different things.

## def-per-support-condition (2026-10-21 19:10 UTC, branch head fe2b3a11489)

Read the item in full (definition only, no new nodes, no steps), the master and main-20261015 source (identical body; uses def-trf-dualizing-complex), and every stmt_dep statement. The SuppCon formula is unchanged and checked on small cases: K=0; Spec of a separably closed field with V[0] and V[1] passing and V[-1] failing; L[d] passing and L[0] failing on a smooth d-fold. The nonzero-fibre support via lem-per-adic-heart-pullback-fibres is well typed, and its dimension equals that of its closure. The worker's dispute is correct: def-trf-dualizing-complex only covers the finite-field datum. C1/F (decisive): D_X, and so CosuppCon, comes only from lem-per-qbar-arbitrary-field-duality. That node was created by the dropped Q144 split 5ea9835359, sits in the 2026-10-19 artin-gabber section of side-live coord/route-pivot-dropped.txt (line 1836), and is in removed_deps of coord/repair-notes/lem-per-artin-gabber-affine-curve.json, which forbids 'arbitrary-field Qbar_l Verdier duality or biduality'. The report does not mention the drop. The item is live, but no live node gives Qbar_l duality over an arbitrary field (thm-coef-qbar-verdier and def-trf-dualizing-complex are finite-field only), and adding a statement-only lemma for it would recreate the dropped node, so this is not a citation FIX. The delivery also types both predicates as Qbar-only, while the live citer lem-per-artin-gabber-affine-curve reads them at finite Lambda in D_ctf. Batch-5 findings: the def-pod-lisse path is a general definition and would be acceptable; the qbar-duality path ends in commutative algebra (universally catenary) and would be acceptable, but the node is dropped. Artin-Gabber route finding upheld. This is the 14th or later delivery with the same dropped cite (Q31, Q63, NU x3, NO, NE, NQ, NI, NG, ND, N0, NY, O3 all RETURNed), so it is a dispatch loop. The maintainer must choose the scope by repair note: finite-field Qbar, or finite Lambda with the ordinary dual of prop-asd-internal-adjunction and thm-amb-etale-exceptional-adjoint, or an un-drop.
