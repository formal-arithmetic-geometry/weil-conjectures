# BZ133 complete

- Branch: `u9/BZ133`.
- All four assigned modules passed `ucheck-bump` together: rc=0, failed=0, 4216 jobs.
- Checked source commit: `145f9e74c47425595177ae3c1948ed9381a251e5`.
- Each assigned target rebuilt successfully on `newsrv:/home/ubuntu/u9n/bumpw9`.
- Full build log: `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/BUILD-BZ133-final-full.log`.
- The user instructed continuation after the exact definition-body repair proposal for
  `injectiveResolutionDerivedComparison`; that patch is now applied.
- The obsolete `quotientCompQhIso` factor and its proof rewrites are removed because `Plus.Q`
  now directly lifts `Q`. All declaration types remain unchanged.
- Completion marker: `/home/ubuntu/u9/state/BZ133.DONE`.
- This final commit changes only progress documentation after the successful source build.
- Fix patterns and build logs: `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/FIXES-BZ133.md`.
- No local Lean/Lake execution, forbidden proof escapes, or heartbeat increases.

# BZ118 in progress

- Branch: `u9/BZ118`.
- Three assigned modules passed the first repair build (commit `ccbe951d0655`).
- `TraceShiftUnit` needed canonical endpoint transport in its public statement because Mathlib marks `Qh` `no_expose`.
- The user instructed continuation after the explicit statement-adjustment proposal; that exact patch is now applied.
- Next: validate all four modules with `ucheck-bump`, then write `/home/ubuntu/u9/state/BZ118.DONE`.
- Fix patterns and build logs: `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/FIXES-BZ118.md`.
- No local Lean/Lake execution; no forbidden proof escapes or heartbeat increases.

- Fix patterns: `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/FIXES-BZ130.md`.

  The local comparison in `SupportedComplexSingleRealization` now uses direct Q;
  all other declaration statements and all existing docstrings are unchanged.
- No local Lean/Lake, proof placeholders, trust bypasses, or heartbeat increases.
- Completion marker: `/home/ubuntu/u9/state/BZ130.DONE`.

# BZ154 complete

- Branch: `u9/BZ154`, starting commit `80aeb4bf4`.
- All four assigned modules passed together through `ucheck-bump`: rc=0, failed=0, 3457 jobs.
- Validated source commit: `d26e23a372af96d353232cce73966fa427f1419d`.
- Each assigned module rebuilt successfully on `newsrv:/home/ubuntu/u9n/bumpw2`.
- Full build log: `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/BUILD-BZ154-final-full.log`.
- The user instructed continuation after the exact one-line statement correction in
  `BZ154-shift-statement-proposal.patch`; that patch is applied and validated.
- The shift comparison's target is quotient followed by `Plus.Qh`, matching its existing
  construction and homotopy-category unit. Other changes are the mandated composition
  isomorphism migration and imports for private definitional reductions.
- Fix patterns and whole-tree occurrence counts: `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/FIXES-BZ154.md`.
- No local Lean/Lake execution, proof placeholders, trust bypasses, or heartbeat increases.
- Completion marker: `/home/ubuntu/u9/state/BZ154.DONE`.

# BZ229 complete

- Branch: `u9/BZ229`; starting commit: `c0384594d`.
- Assigned module: `WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.Endofunctor.IsoAlgebraDerivedRightAdjointLift`.
- The module passed `ucheck-bump`: rc=0, failed=0, 2110 jobs; target rebuilt in 10 seconds.

- Build tree: `newsrv:/home/ubuntu/u9n/bumpw1`.
- Full build log: `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/BUILD-BZ229-final-full.log`.
- The user instructed continuation after the explicit one-token statement correction proposal.
  Applied `.hom` -> `.inv` in the composition-factor helper to preserve its original map
  after adopting Mathlib's reversed composition isomorphism. Other statement types and
  all existing docstrings are unchanged.
- Definition bodies and inverse cancellation now use the new composition orientation.
  Two trailing `rfl` tactics after `simp` were removed. The final `rfl` after `erw` is needed
  in this module and is retained.
- Fix patterns and whole-tree counts: `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/FIXES-BZ229.md`.
- No local Lean/Lake execution, proof placeholders, trust bypasses, or heartbeat increases.
- Completion marker: `/home/ubuntu/u9/state/BZ229.DONE`.

  and `WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.Abelian.DerivedBottomUnitNormalization`.

  Those canonical quotientCompQhIso endpoint transports are the only Lean changes;
  all proof bodies, declaration binders, assumptions, and docstrings are unchanged.

# BZ395 in progress

- Branch: `u9/BZ395`; baseline commit: `9bc0d70a6`.
- Owned module: `WeilConjectures.AlgebraicGeometry.ProfinitePointPullback`.
- Baseline remote build found five errors in three statement headers.
- The user instructed continuation after the exact API-only statement patch proposal.
  Applied that patch: use the reversed Mathlib compositor and repair two misplaced
  `.symm` projections, preserving the intended maps.
- Owned module passed `ucheck-bump`: rc=0, failed=0, 3949 jobs, at `ec3927a96a`.
- Added explicit `Iso.symm_hom` / `Iso.symm_inv` normalization at eight restricted
  simp sites after the header migration. Continuing with four direct importers.
- Fix patterns, exact errors, and whole-tree counts: `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/FIXES-BZ395.md`.
- No local Lean/Lake execution, proof placeholders, trust bypasses, or limit increases.
