# BZ118 in progress

- Branch: `u9/BZ118`.
- Three assigned modules passed the first repair build (commit `ccbe951d0655`).

  after adopting Mathlib's reversed composition isomorphism. Other statement types and
  all existing docstrings are unchanged.

  Two trailing `rfl` tactics after `simp` were removed. The final `rfl` after `erw` is needed
  in this module and is retained.

# BZ384 in progress

- Branch: `u9/BZ384`; starting commit: `98654719b`.
- Baseline remote build confirmed five errors in compositor directions in declaration types.
- The user instructed continuation after the explicit nine-direction patch proposal.
  That patch is now applied, preserving the original equations under Mathlib's reversed compositor.
- Next: remote validation of the assigned module, then its three direct importers.
- Fix patterns and baseline log: `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/FIXES-BZ384.md`.

  Applied `.symm` to both composition comparisons in
  `injectiveSections_strictLocal_comparison`, preserving the original map directions
  under Mathlib's reversed compositor.
- Pinned API inspected at b63f6e8a; known quotient patterns do not match this module.
- Next: remote validation, then up to four direct importers and a second downstream layer.
- Fix patterns: `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/FIXES-BZ469.md`.
- No local Lean/Lake execution, proof placeholders, trust bypasses, or heartbeat changes.

# BZ511 in progress

- Branch: `u9/BZ511`; starting commit: `fa248eeed`.
- The user instructed continuation after the exact two-private-helper API proposal.
  The compositor inverse in `derivedCompSingle` and the direct compositor in
  `derivedTripleNatSingle` are applied. The public theorem statement is unchanged.
- Proofs now use Mathlib's single-object compositor lemma, hom naturality, and
  hom/inv cancellation; the redundant `rfl` after `simp only` is removed.
- Pinned Mathlib source was inspected at b63f6e8a. Patterns, occurrence counts,
  and integration errors: `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/FIXES-BZ511.md`.
- Existing `ucheck-bump` invocation is queued; it reads the pushed branch after
  acquiring a tree. Next: validate the owned module and continue downstream.

- The user instructed continuation after the explicit private-helper compositor proposal.
  Migrated the assigned helpers and their downstream copies to Mathlib's reversed
  composition isomorphism, with the matching hom/inv cancellation. Public statements
  and existing docstrings are unchanged.
- Reused BZ549's dependency repairs and then merged coordinator sweep29; the remaining
  Lean diff against that coordinator base is confined to the two mate-normalization files.
- Second-layer CategoryTheory.Integral.IntegralResidueTensorPresentation was skipped:
  its unowned IntegralResidueRestrictPullComp and IntegralResiduePullSquareIsIso
  dependencies failed. No changes to those dependencies.
- Fix patterns, exact errors, occurrence counts and all four validated module names:
  `/home/ubuntu/u9/bz/FIXES-BZ566.md`.
