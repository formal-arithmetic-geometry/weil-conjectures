# Derived Upper Star and Lower Star

The derived pullback and pushforward of étale sheaves are *not* given definitions of
their own: they are the generic derived-functor constructions of the folder
`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.DerivedCategory` applied to the underived pullback
`(g)^*[A]` and pushforward `(g)_*[A]`, and they are written by nesting the generic
notations inside the underived ones:

| derived functor | notation | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Rg_* : D(Z_ét) ⥤ D(Y_ét)` | `R((g)_*[A])` | `(g)_*[A].rightDerivedFunctor` |
| `Rg_* : D⁺(Z_ét) ⥤ D⁺(Y_ét)` | `R+((g)_*[A])` | `(g)_*[A].rightDerivedFunctorPlus` |
| `Lg^* : D(Y_ét) ⥤ D(Z_ét)` | `L((g)^*[A])` | `(g)^*[A].leftDerivedFunctor` |
| `g^* : D(Y_ét) ⥤ D(Z_ét)` | `D((g)^*[A])` | `(g)^*[A].mapDerivedCategory` |
| `g^* : D⁺(Y_ét) ⥤ D⁺(Z_ét)` | `D+((g)^*[A])` | `(g)^*[A].mapDerivedCategoryPlus` |

The generic notations `R(-)`, `R+(-)`, `L(-)`, `D(-)` and `D+(-)` are scoped in the
`CategoryTheory.Functor` namespace, so a file using them needs
`open scoped CategoryTheory.Functor`. Each row above is recorded below as an `example`,
at the place where a definition of the corresponding functor would have stood, so that
the type of the functor is spelled out.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.leftDerivedUpperStarIsoMapDerivedCategory` : the derived
  pullback `L((g)^*[A])` is the functor `D((g)^*[A])` induced levelwise by the exact
  functor `g^*`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.leftDerivedUpperStarComp` : the composition isomorphism
  `L(g₁ ≫ g₂)^* ≅ Lg₂^* ⋙ Lg₁^*`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.leftDerivedUpperStarHomologyFunctorIso` : the derived pullback
  commutes with the homology functors, `H^n ⋙ g^* ≅ Lg^* ⋙ H^n`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.singleFunctorCompLeftDerivedUpperStarIso` : the derived
  pullback of a sheaf placed in degree `0` is the pullback of the sheaf placed in degree
  `0`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.mapDerivedUpperStarLowerStarAdjunction`,
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.derivedUpperStarLowerStarAdjunction` and
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.derivedUpperStarLowerStarAdjunctionPlus` : the derived
  adjunctions `D((g)^*[A]) ⊣ R((g)_*[A])`, `L((g)^*[A]) ⊣ R((g)_*[A])` and
  `D+((g)^*[A]) ⊣ R+((g)_*[A])`. The first one needs no monoidal structure on `A`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.rightDerivedLowerStarComp` : the composition isomorphism
  `Rg₁_* ⋙ Rg₂_* ≅ R(g₁ ≫ g₂)_*`, conjugate to the composition isomorphism of the functors
  `D(g^*)`. It needs no monoidal structure on `A`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.rightDerivedLowerStarCongr` : the isomorphism `Rg₁_* ≅ Rg₂_*`
  induced by an equality `g₁ = g₂`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.linear_rightDerivedLowerStar` and
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.linear_leftDerivedUpperStar` : for a `Λ`-linear `A`, the derived
  functors `Rg_*` and `Lg^*` are `Λ`-linear.

## The derived pullback `Lg^*`

The pullback `g^* = Etale.upperStar` is left derived using the K-flat left
derivability structure of `WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.DerivedCategory.LeftDerivedFunctor.Defs`.
This requires the source sheaf category `Sheaf Y.smallEtaleTopology A` to carry a
preadditive monoidal structure whose tensor product preserves colimits, to have countable
coproducts and exact `ℤ`-indexed colimits, and to admit functorial flat resolutions.
These inputs are stated as hypotheses on the coefficient category `A` only; they are
supplied for the sheaf categories by the instances of the folder
`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.GrothendieckAbelian`, with the monoidal structure and its
compatibility with colimits provided by its `Monoidal` subfolder, and its preadditivity
by `CategoryTheory.Sheaf.monoidalPreadditive`, which holds for any sheaf category.

One of those instances is still `sorry`ed, so everything below depends on it:
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.hasFunctorialFlatResolution_sheaf` (functorial flat resolutions
of étale sheaves), discussed in the module docstring of the file that states it. The
tensor-colimit input is no longer among them: it is now proved, by Day's reflection
theorem, in `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.preservesColimitsOfSize_tensorLeft_sheaf`.

The additivity and exactness of `g^*` are `Etale.additive_upperStar`,
`Etale.preservesFiniteLimits_upperStar` and `Etale.preservesHomology_upperStar` of
`WeilConjectures.SixFunctors.Etale.UpperLowerStar.Defs`; the left exactness there rests on the
sorried `HasSheafify` instance for the small étale site of `Z` and on left exactness of
the left Kan extension along the opposite of base change, both global instances of the
folder `WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.GrothendieckAbelian` (for an étale `g` the latter
is proved, not sorried). Since `g^*` is exact, it preserves in particular all K-flat
quasi-isomorphisms, which is the input needed by the derivability-structure machinery.

étale sheaf categories, see
`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.GrothendieckAbelian.Monoidal.Defs`. Closedness and the
symmetry moreover make the étale sheaf categories monoidal closed by Day's reflection
theorem, hence make tensoring by a fixed sheaf preserve colimits, which is what the
tensor product of complexes needs, see

It is not a definition of its own: it is the generic `Functor.leftDerivedFunctor`,

Since `g^*` is exact, the counit `Lg^* ∘ Q ⟶ Q ∘ g^*` is in fact an isomorphism
everywhere; the construction via the derivability structure is uniform in the functor
and applies verbatim once `g^*` is replaced by a non-exact functor (e.g. the pullback
of sheaves of modules over a varying sheaf of rings). -/

## The derived adjunction `Lg^* ⊣ Rg_*`

The adjunction `g^* ⊣ g_*` between the pullback and the pushforward of étale sheaves
induces an adjunction `Lg^* ⊣ Rg_*` between their total derived functors on the
unbounded derived categories, by
`CategoryTheory.Adjunction.derivedAdjunction`
(`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.DerivedCategory.Adjunction`): the left adjoint is
derived via the K-flat left derivability structure on `D(Y_ét)` and the right adjoint
via the K-injective right derivability structure on `D(Z_ét)`, and the two
"absoluteness" hypotheses of mathlib's abstract theorem `Adjunction.derived` hold
because the derived-functor comparison maps are isomorphisms on K-flat, respectively
K-injective, complexes.

The hypotheses of this section are those of the section `DerivedUpperStar`: the
K-injective resolutions on the pushforward side are supplied by the sheaf category
being Grothendieck abelian.
