## The derived adjunction `j_! ⊣ j^*` along an open immersion

This is the pro-étale counterpart of
`WeilConjectures.SixFunctors.Etale.Derived.OpenImmersionLowerShriek`.

For an open immersion `j : U ⟶ X` both halves of the adjunction
`ProEtale.openImmersionLowerShriekUpperStarAdjunction` are *exact*: the extension by zero
`j_!` by `ProEtale.preservesFiniteLimits_openImmersionLowerShriek` together with its being
a left adjoint, and the pullback `j^*` by `ProEtale.preservesFiniteLimits_upperStar`
together with its being a left adjoint. So each of them induces a functor on derived
categories by applying it levelwise, and the two levelwise functors are again adjoint.

The adjunction is obtained where the derived formalism provides it, namely between the
*total* derived functors: `Adjunction.derivedAdjunction` gives
`(j_!).leftDerivedFunctor ⊣ (j^*).rightDerivedFunctor`, the left one computed by K-flat
resolutions and the right one by K-injective resolutions. Exactness then identifies each
with the corresponding levelwise functor
(`Functor.leftDerivedFunctorIsoMapDerivedCategory` and
`Functor.rightDerivedFunctorIsoMapDerivedCategory`), and the resulting adjunction on the
unbounded derived categories restricts along the fully faithful inclusions of the bounded
below ones. Both steps are the general
`Adjunction.mapDerivedCategoryAdjunction` and `Adjunction.mapDerivedCategoryPlusAdjunction`
of `WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.DerivedCategory.Adjunction`.

In particular the K-flat and K-injective machinery, and with it the coefficient
hypotheses of the section `DerivedUpperStar`, are still needed even though the final
statement mentions only levelwise functors.

/-- Blueprint `prop-exc-open-adjoint`: the derived adjunction `j_! ⊣ j^*` along an open
immersion `j : U ⟶ X` on the unbounded derived categories of pro-étale sheaves, with no
constructibility or finite Tor hypothesis: since both `j_!` and `j^*` are exact,
their total derived functors are the levelwise functors, and the adjunction between the
total left derived functor of `j_!` and the total right derived functor of `j^*` becomes
an adjunction between the levelwise functors. -/
