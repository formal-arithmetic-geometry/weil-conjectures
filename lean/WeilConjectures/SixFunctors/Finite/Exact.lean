# Exactness of the direct image along a finite morphism

For a finite morphism `f : X ⟶ Y`, the pushforward `f_*` on étale sheaves is exact
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.preservesFiniteColimits_lowerStar_of_isFinite`): it is left exact
for any morphism, and it preserves epimorphisms because on the stalk at a geometric point `y`
with algebraically closed residue field it is the finite product of the stalk maps at the
geometric points over `y` (`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.lowerStarSheafFiberIsoPi`), and these
stalks jointly detect epimorphisms
(`CategoryTheory.JointlyReflectIsomorphisms.epi_of_epi_map` applied to the conservative
family `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.uliftPointSmallEtale` of geometric points).

Consequently the total right derived functor of `f_*` is `f_*` applied levelwise
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.rightDerivedFunctorLowerStarIsoMapDerivedCategory`).

Two restrictions are forced by the stalk formula and are not artefacts of the proof: `f` is
finite rather than integral, since the geometric fibre has to be finite; and the geometric
points used are those with *algebraically* closed residue field, since
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.GeometricFiber` is the set of `Ω`-points of the fibre, which
for a merely separably closed `Ω` need not exhaust the topological fibre. The latter costs
nothing because these points already form a conservative family, which is how
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.uliftPointSmallEtale` is defined.

Besides the standing assumptions on the coefficient category `A`, the results need `A` to be
concrete over `Type (u + 1)` in a way compatible with filtered colimits and sheafification,
since that is what the conservativity of the geometric points asks for. This holds for
`A = ModuleCat.{u + 1} Λ`.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.epi_sheafFiber_lowerStar_map_of_isFinite`: `f_*` of an
  epimorphism is an epimorphism on the stalk at a geometric point with algebraically closed
  residue field.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.preservesEpimorphisms_lowerStar_of_isFinite`: the direct image
  along a finite morphism preserves epimorphisms.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.preservesFiniteColimits_lowerStar_of_isFinite`: the direct image
  along a finite morphism is exact.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.rightDerivedFunctorLowerStarIsoMapDerivedCategory`: its total
  right derived functor is itself, applied levelwise to complexes.
