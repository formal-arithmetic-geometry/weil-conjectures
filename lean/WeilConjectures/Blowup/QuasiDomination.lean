# Quasi-domination

Let `x : X ⟶ S` and `y : Y ⟶ S` be morphisms of schemes with `y` separated. A
*quasi-domination of `X` over `Y`* is a morphism `hom : U ⟶ Y` over `S`, defined on a dense
open `U ⊆ X`, whose graph is closed in the full fibre product `Y ×ₛ X`. Closedness is
demanded in `Y ×ₛ X`, not merely in `Y ×ₛ U`, where it would be automatic from separatedness
of `y`; it is exactly this stronger requirement that is propagated by the partial-section
extension theorem `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_admissibleBlowup_extend_section`.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.QuasiDomination`: the data of a quasi-domination of `X` over `Y`;
- `AlgebraicGeometry.QuasiDomination.graph`: the graph `U ⟶ Y ×ₛ X` of a quasi-domination;
- `AlgebraicGeometry.QuasiDomination.Extends`: a quasi-domination extends a morphism defined
  on a smaller open (blueprint: `def-nagata-conrad-quasi-domination`).

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.QuasiDomination.of_isSeparated`: a morphism to a separated target is a
  quasi-domination of its own source (blueprint:
  `lemma-nagata-conrad-morphism-is-quasi-domination`);
- `AlgebraicGeometry.QuasiDomination.U_eq_top`: a quasi-domination over a universally closed
  target is defined everywhere (blueprint:
  `lemma:nagata-conrad-quasi-domination-proper-target`).

Quasi-domination.

A quasi-domination of `x : X ⟶ S` over a separated `y : Y ⟶ S` is a morphism `hom : U ⟶ Y`
over `S`, defined on a dense open `U ⊆ X`, whose graph `U ⟶ Y ×ₛ X` has closed range.

```text
    U ──hom──→ Y
    │          │
U.ι │          │ y
    ↓          ↓
    X ───x───→ S
```

The graph is the morphism `U ⟶ Y ×ₛ X` induced by this square, and the condition is that
its range be closed.

For a separated `y : Y ⟶ S` and any `hom : U ⟶ Y`, the pair `(U, hom)` is a quasi-domination
of `U` over `Y`: the open `U ⊆ U` is dense, and the graph is a section of the separated
`Y ×ₛ U ⟶ U`, hence a closed immersion. -/

The projection `pullback.snd y x : Y ×ₛ X ⟶ X` is universally closed, being a base change of
`y`, so the closed range of the graph maps onto a closed subset of `X`. That subset is `U`,
which is therefore closed as well as dense, hence all of `X`. -/

Both results about quasi-dominations are unconditional: the checks below are run by the
build, so a `sorry` reappearing anywhere beneath them breaks compilation rather than going
unnoticed. -/
