/-- Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Lemma Tag 07PF:
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-hypersurface-derivation-regular).
The quotient of a regular ring by `f` is regular if an absolute derivation sends `f`
to a unit in the quotient. Absolute derivations are represented by `ℤ`-derivations:
additive maps are automatically `ℤ`-linear, and the Leibniz rule forces `D 1 = 0`.

Proof:
1. The quotient is Noetherian. For any prime `q` of the quotient, take its inverse
   image `p` in `R`. The element `f` lies in `p`, whereas `D(f)` does not: its
   image is a unit, and a proper prime ideal cannot contain a unit. This also
   covers a unit `f` vacuously, since its quotient has no primes.
2. Extend `D` to `R_p` using `lem-weil-pbc-derivation-extends`. The image of `f`
   lies in the maximal ideal, and the derivative of this image is a unit because
   `D(f)` lies outside `p`. Induction on sums of products in the square of the
   maximal ideal, using additivity and Leibniz, shows that their derivatives lie
   in the maximal ideal. Therefore the image of `f` is outside that square.
   Apply `lem-weil-pbc-regular-local-hypersurface-criterion` to its local quotient.
3. Mathlib's quotient-localization instance and `IsLocalization.algEquiv` identify
   this regular local quotient with the localization of `R/(f)` at `q`, as in
   `lem-weil-pbc-localization-at-prime-of-quotient`. Transport regular localness
   along the equivalence. The regular-ring local criterion concludes.
