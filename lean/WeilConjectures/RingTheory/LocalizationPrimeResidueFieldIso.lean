/-- A localization induces the prime-ideal correspondence and canonical isomorphisms of
local rings and residue fields. Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tags 00E3, 00C9 and 07BH
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-localization-prime-residue-field-iso).

Proof:
1. The contraction `q` of `q'` is prime: one does not lie in it and primality pulls back
   along the ring map. It is disjoint from `W` because every denominator maps to a unit,
   whereas a proper prime ideal contains no units.
2. For a prime `p` disjoint from `W`, the extension consists of fractions with numerator
   in `p`, by bringing finite sums to a common denominator. If the image of `x` is such
   a fraction `a/w`, the localization kernel condition gives `t * (w*x-a) = 0` for some
   `t` in `W`. Thus `twx` lies in `p`; since `tw` does not, `x` lies in `p`. This proves
   that the contraction of the extension is `p` and that the extension is proper.
3. If a product of two fractions lies in the extension of `p`, its numerator lies in
   `p` by step 2. Primality of `p` puts one numerator in `p`, proving the extension prime.
4. A fraction in `q'` has numerator in `q`, giving extension of contraction equal to
   `q'`. Steps 1-3 and this identity give mutually inverse maps on the indicated primes
   (Tag 00E3).
5. Localize `A'` at the complement of `q'` (def-weil-pbc-localization-at-prime).
   By lem-weil-pbc-localization-of-localization, the composite is a localization at
   the set of `x` with image `n * image(w)`, where `n` is outside `q'` and `w` is in `W`.
   This set is exactly the complement of `q`: use `w = 1` in one direction; in the
   other direction `image(w)` is a unit and primality excludes their product from `q'`.
   Uniqueness of localization gives the `A`-algebra isomorphism `e`, whose ring map is
   `Localization.localRingHom`, hence sends `a/s` to `image(a)/image(s)` (Tag 00C9).
6. These local rings have maximal ideals the extensions of `q` and `q'`
   (def-weil-pbc-localization-at-prime). The isomorphism carries the unique maximal
   ideal onto the unique maximal ideal. Passing to their quotients gives the field
   isomorphism `σ`. It commutes with the residue maps and is an `A`-algebra isomorphism
   because `e` is one (Tag 07BH). -/
