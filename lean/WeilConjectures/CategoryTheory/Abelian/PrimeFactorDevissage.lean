# Prime-factor dévissage in an abelian category

Let `F` be an object of an abelian category killed by a positive integer `n`, and let `r` be a
prime dividing `n`. Multiplication by `r` gives the short exact sequence

`0 ⟶ F[r] ⟶ F ⟶ rF ⟶ 0`,

where `F[r] = ker (r : F ⟶ F)` is killed by `r` and `rF = im (r : F ⟶ F)` is killed by `n / r`.
By induction on `n`, a property of objects which is stable under extensions and holds for
all objects killed by a prime holds for all objects killed by a positive integer.

## Main definitions

- `CategoryTheory.Abelian.nsmulShortComplex`: the short complex `F[r] ⟶ F ⟶ rF`.

## Main statements

- `CategoryTheory.Abelian.shortExact_nsmulShortComplex`: it is short exact.
- `CategoryTheory.Abelian.nsmul_id_kernel_eq_zero`,
  `CategoryTheory.Abelian.nsmul_id_image_eq_zero`: the orders of its outer terms.
- `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.prop_of_nsmul_id_eq_zero`: the dévissage.

/-- **Prime-factor dévissage.** Let `P` be a property of objects of an abelian category which
is stable under extensions and holds for every object killed by a prime. Then `P` holds for
every object killed by a positive integer `n`: choosing a prime `r ∣ n`, the short exact
sequence `0 ⟶ F[r] ⟶ F ⟶ rF ⟶ 0` has `F[r]` killed by `r` and `rF` killed by `n / r < n`,
and one inducts on `n`.
