# Bounded flat complexes with finite cohomology over a Noetherian ring are perfect

Let `A` be a Noetherian ring and `C` an object of `D(A)` represented by a bounded complex of flat
`A`-modules, all of whose cohomology modules are finitely generated. Then `C` is represented by a
bounded complex of finitely generated projective `A`-modules
(`DerivedCategory.isPerfect_of_flat_of_finite_homology`).

A bounded complex `F` of flat modules concentrated in `[a, b]` is K-flat, so for every module `N`
the derived tensor product `F ⊗ᴸ N` is the tensor product of complexes `F ⊗ N`, concentrated in
`[a, b]`: `C` has Tor amplitude in `[a, b]` (`DerivedCategory.torAmplitudeIn_Q_obj_of_flat`).
A bounded complex with finitely generated cohomology and finite Tor amplitude over a Noetherian
ring is perfect (`DerivedCategory.isPerfect_of_finiteTorAmplitude`): one resolves `C` by finite
free modules from the top degree down, and the cokernel in the lowest degree `a` is flat by the
Tor criterion, as `H^{a-1}(F ⊗ N) = 0`, and finitely presented, hence projective.

/-- **A bounded flat complex with finite cohomology over a Noetherian ring is perfect.** Let `A`
be Noetherian and `C` an object of `D(A)` isomorphic to the image of a complex `F` of flat
`A`-modules concentrated in degrees `[a, b]`. If every cohomology module `H^i(C)` is finitely
generated, then `C` is represented by a bounded complex of finitely generated projective
`A`-modules (`DerivedCategory.IsPerfect`).

The complex `F` gives `C` Tor amplitude in `[a, b]`, and a bounded object with finitely
generated cohomology and finite Tor amplitude is perfect.
