# Rationalization of an `R`-linear triangulated category

Let `C` be a triangulated category which is linear over a commutative ring `R`, with
`R`-linear shift functors, and let `M` be a submonoid of `R`. An object `X` of `C` is
*`M`-torsion* if `m • 𝟙 X = 0` for some `m ∈ M`. The `M`-torsion objects form a
triangulated subcategory `Rationalization.torsion M C`, and the *rationalization*

```
  Rationalization M C  :=  C / (M-torsion objects)
```

is the Verdier quotient by it: the localization of `C` at the class
`Rationalization.W M C` of morphisms whose mapping cone is annihilated by an element of
`M`. It is again a triangulated category, and the localization functor
`Rationalization.Q M C : C ⥤ Rationalization M C` is a triangulated functor.

For `m ∈ M` the mapping cone of `m • 𝟙 X` is annihilated by `m²`
(`Rationalization.smul_id_cone_eq_zero`), so the morphisms `m • 𝟙 X` are inverted in the
rationalization. Consequently every `m ∈ M` acts invertibly on the `Hom` groups of
`Rationalization M C`, and the rationalization is linear over any localization `A` of `R`
at `M` (`Rationalization.linear`), compatibly with its `R`-linear structure
(`Rationalization.algebraMap_smul`). Inverting a single element `π` of `R` is the case
`M = Submonoid.powers π`; the case of interest downstream is that of the ring of integers
`R = 𝒪_E` of an `ℓ`-adic field `E`, with `M` its nonzero elements and `A = E`.

## Main definitions

- `CategoryTheory.Rationalization.torsion` : the `M`-torsion objects of `C`.
- `CategoryTheory.Rationalization.W` : the morphisms with `M`-torsion mapping cone.
- `CategoryTheory.Rationalization` : the Verdier quotient of `C` by the `M`-torsion
  objects, a triangulated category.
- `CategoryTheory.Rationalization.Q` : the localization functor `C ⥤ Rationalization M C`.
- `CategoryTheory.Rationalization.linear` : the `A`-linear structure, for `A` a
  localization of `R` at `M`.

## Main results

- `CategoryTheory.Rationalization.instIsTriangulatedTorsion` : the `M`-torsion objects form
  a triangulated subcategory.
- `CategoryTheory.Rationalization.W_smul_id` : `m • 𝟙 X` lies in `W M C` for `m ∈ M`.
- `CategoryTheory.Rationalization.isIso_smul_id` : `m • 𝟙 Y` is an isomorphism of the
  rationalization for `m ∈ M`.
