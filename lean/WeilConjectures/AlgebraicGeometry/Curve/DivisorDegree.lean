# The degree of the line bundle of an effective divisor

Let `X` be a smooth proper curve over a field `k` and `E = ∑_P n_P [P]` an effective divisor on
`X`, with invertible ideal sheaf `𝒪_X(-E) = ∏_P 𝓘_P^{n_P}`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Divisor.idealSheaf`). The degree of a line bundle is defined
cohomologically, `deg ℒ = χ(ℒ) - χ(𝒪_X)` (`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.degree`). This file
identifies the degree of `𝒪_X(E) = 𝒪_X(-E)^∨` with the degree of the divisor `E`:
`deg 𝒪_X(E) = ∑_P n_P [κ(P) : k]`, which over an algebraically closed field is the degree
`∑_P n_P` of `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Divisor.degree`.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.degreeOver_eq_one_of_isAlgClosed`: over an algebraically closed
  field, closed points of a scheme locally of finite type have degree one.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Divisor.degree_dual_toModules_idealSheaf`:
  `deg 𝒪_X(E) = ∑_P n_P [κ(P) : k]` (blueprint `lem-pc-degree-agrees-sc`).
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Divisor.degree_dual_toModules_idealSheaf_eq_degree`: over an
  algebraically closed field, `deg 𝒪_X(E) = deg E` (blueprint `lem-pc-degree-agrees-sc`).

/-- **The degree of the line bundle of an effective divisor.** Let `E = ∑_P n_P [P]` be an
effective divisor on a smooth proper curve `X` over `k`. The degree
`deg 𝒪_X(E) = χ(𝒪_X(E)) - χ(𝒪_X)` of its line bundle `𝒪_X(E) = 𝒪_X(-E)^∨`, where
`𝒪_X(-E) = ∏_P 𝓘_P^{n_P}`, is `∑_P n_P [κ(P) : k]`.

The χ-degree of `𝒪_X(E)` is `dim_k Γ(E, 𝒪_E)`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData.IsInvertible.degree_dual_toModules`), and
`dim_k Γ(E, 𝒪_E) = ∑_P n_P [κ(P) : k]`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Divisor.finrankΓ_subschemeι_idealSheaf`).

/-- **The degree of a line bundle agrees with the degree of divisors.** Let `E = ∑_P n_P [P]` be
an effective divisor on a smooth proper curve `X` over an algebraically closed field `k`. Then
the degree `deg 𝒪_X(E) = χ(𝒪_X(E)) - χ(𝒪_X)` of its line bundle `𝒪_X(E) = 𝒪_X(-E)^∨`, where
`𝒪_X(-E) = ∏_P 𝓘_P^{n_P}`, is the degree `deg E = ∑_P n_P` of `E` as a divisor
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Divisor.degree`). In particular `deg 𝒪_X([P]) = 1` for a closed
point `P`.
