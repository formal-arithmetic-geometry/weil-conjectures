# Invariance of the cohomology of an affine curve under algebraically closed extension

Let `k ⊆ k'` be algebraically closed fields and `C` a smooth affine connected curve over `k`, with
smooth compactification `C ⊆ C̄`. The base change `C̄_{k'}` is a smooth compactification of
`C_{k'}` of the same genus, with a boundary of the same size, since the boundary points are
`k`-rational. Hence `|H¹(C, ℤ/n)| = |H¹(C_{k'}, ℤ/n)|`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.IsConnectedCurve.natCard_sheafH_one_constantZMod_mul`), and the pullback
`Hᵠ(C, ℤ/n) ⟶ Hᵠ(C_{k'}, ℤ/n)`, which is injective, is bijective.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.baseChangeField`: the base change of a compactification.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsConnectedCurve.bijective_fieldExtensionCohomologyMap_of_isAffine`: the
  invariance of `Hᵠ(C, ℤ/n)` for a smooth affine connected curve.
