/-- A qc separated smooth curve of relative dimension one is a finite coproduct
of connected smooth curves, compatibly with its structure map.
Source: blueprint sk-prop-ext-invariance, first step.
(blueprint: lem-sc-smooth-curve-connected-coproduct)

Proof: Finite type over the field makes C Noetherian. Its connected components
are finitely many clopen subsets. Give each its open subscheme structure and
restrict f. The restricted morphisms remain separated, of finite type, and
smooth of relative dimension one. Each component is connected and nonempty,
so the dimension theorem for nonempty smooth schemes gives dimension exactly
one. Disjointness and coverage give the coproduct universal property. If C is
empty the component index set is empty and the same universal property applies. -/
