# Weight strata of a rational polynomial

Let `R ∈ ℚ[T]` have constant coefficient `1`. Its complex roots split into the ones that are
universally pure of weight `w` — every conjugate has absolute value `q ^ (-w / 2)` — and the
others. This file shows that this partition of the roots comes from a factorisation of `R`
*over `ℚ`*: the corresponding factor is a product of irreducible rational factors of `R`, and is
the unique normalized complex factor with the given roots.

The point is that the *universal* purity condition is constant on each irreducible rational
factor `f` of `R`: `f` is, up to a scalar, the minimal polynomial of each of its complex roots.
So no Galois descent is needed — the stratum is a product of rational polynomials by
construction. This fails for purity under a single embedding: the roots of
`(1 - (1 + √2) T) (1 - (1 - √2) T) ∈ ℚ[T]` of a given absolute value do not cut out a rational
factor.

## Main results

- `Polynomial.weightFactor`, `Polynomial.coweightFactor` — the product of the normalized
  irreducible rational factors of `R` all of whose complex roots have absolute value
  `q ^ (-w / 2)`, and the product of the remaining ones.
- `Polynomial.weightFactor_mul_coweightFactor` — the two factors multiply back to `R`.
- `Polynomial.roots_map_weightFactor` — the complex roots of `R.weightFactor q w` are exactly
  the roots of `R` that are universally pure of weight `w`.
- `Polynomial.eq_map_weightFactor_of_isUniversallyPure` — a normalized complex factorisation of
  `R` separating the universally pure roots of weight `w` from the others has
  `(R.weightFactor q w).map (algebraMap ℚ ℂ)` as its pure part.
