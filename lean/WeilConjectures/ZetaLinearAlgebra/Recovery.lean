# Recovery of the pure factors from the reduced fraction

Let `P 0, …, P r` be complex polynomials with constant coefficient `1`, with `P i` universally
pure of weight `i`, and suppose the two parity products cross-multiply against a coprime
normalized rational fraction `A / B`:
`(∏_{i odd} P i) * B = (∏_{i even} P i) * A`.

The parity products are then `A` and `B` themselves, and each individual factor `P i` is
recovered from the rational data alone: it is the weight-`i` stratum of `A` for odd `i` and of
`B` for even `i`, in particular it is defined over `ℚ`. Since `A` and `B` are, in the situation
of interest, images of normalized integer polynomials, each `P i` is even the image of a
normalized integer polynomial — the integrality half of the Weil factorisation.

## Main results

- `Polynomial.parityPart` — the member `A` or `B` of the fraction that the weight-`w` factor is
  cut out of: the numerator `A` for odd `w`, the denominator `B` for even `w`.
- `Polynomial.eq_map_weightFactor` — each `P i` is the image of the weight-`i` stratum of
  `Polynomial.parityPart A B i`.
- `Polynomial.exists_int_weightFactor` — a weight stratum of the image of a normalized integer
  polynomial is again the image of a normalized integer polynomial.
- `Polynomial.exists_int_of_isUniversallyPure` — the whole family `P` comes from a family of
  normalized integer polynomials.
- `Polynomial.exists_int_norm_eq_of_isUniversallyPure` — the same family, together with the
  Riemann hypothesis statement: every complex root of the `i`-th member has absolute value
  `q ^ (-i / 2)`.
