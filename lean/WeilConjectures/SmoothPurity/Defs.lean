# Smooth purity for `ℚ̄_ℓ`-coefficients on the pro-étale site

Let `ℓ` be a prime and `k` a field of characteristic `p > 0` with `p ≠ ℓ`. As in
`WeilConjectures.SixFunctors.ProEtale.ModuleObject.Derived.BoundedConstructible`, all schemes are
objects `X : Over (Spec (.of k))`, separated and of finite type over `Spec k`, and all morphisms
are morphisms `f : X ⟶ Y` of `Over (Spec (.of k))`; in particular `ℓ` is invertible on every
scheme considered. In the documentation, `X` also stands for the underlying scheme `X.left`.

Let `f : X ⟶ Y` be a morphism whose underlying morphism of schemes `f.left` is smooth of pure
relative dimension `d`. *Smooth purity* (SGA 4, Exposé XVIII, Théorème 3.2.5, and Bhatt–Scholze,
*The pro-étale topology for schemes*, Section 6.8, for `ℚ̄_ℓ`-coefficients) identifies the
exceptional inverse image of the constant coefficient object with a shifted Tate twist:
```
pur_f : Rf^! ℚ̄_ℓ,Y ≅ ℚ̄_ℓ,X(d)[2d]
```
in the derived category `D(Mod_{ℚ̄_ℓ,X})` of module objects over `ℚ̄_ℓ,X = p_X^* ℚ̲̄_ℓ`, the
pullback of the condensed ring `ℚ̲̄_ℓ` (`Profinite.padicAlgClRingObj ℓ`). Here `Rf^!` is
`AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.boundedConstructibleUpperShriek` on the bounded
constructible derived categories `Dᵇc(-)⟦ℚ̲̄_ℓ⟧` (the right adjoint of `Rf_!`, built from the
compactification of `f` chosen by Nagata's theorem), `ℚ̄_ℓ,Y` is the tensor unit of the
monoidal category `Dᵇc(Y)⟦ℚ̲̄_ℓ⟧`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.isMonoidal_boundedConstructible`), whose underlying
complex is the tensor unit of `D(Mod_{ℚ̄_ℓ,Y})`, and `ℚ̄_ℓ,X(d)` is the Tate twist of
`WeilConjectures.TateTwist.ProEtale`. The isomorphism is stated after the inclusion
`Dᵇc(X)⟦ℚ̲̄_ℓ⟧ ⥤ D(Mod_{ℚ̄_ℓ,X})`, which is fully faithful, so that the constructibility of the Tate
twists need not be recorded.

## Sorried data

`AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.smoothPurityIso` is the purity isomorphism, stated as a
`@[no_expose]` definition with value `sorry`: it is a *chosen* isomorphism, which downstream
constructions (the trace map and Poincaré duality, see
`WeilConjectures/PoincareDuality/Instruction.tex`) use as data, and whose normalization they
inherit.

The isomorphism is not a canonical map whose invertibility could be stated as a proposition
with the tools currently available: classically it is the adjoint of the trace map
`Tr_f : Rf_! ℚ̄_ℓ,X(d)[2d] ⟶ ℚ̄_ℓ,Y` of SGA 4, Exposé XVIII, whose construction (by reduction to
relative curves and the cycle class of the diagonal) is not formalized. Its intended
normalization and compatibilities — with composition of smooth morphisms, with base change,
with étale maps (where `d = 0` and `pur` is the identification `Rf^! = Lf^*`), and the
identification of the induced trace with the classical trace on `H^{2d}_c` of a smooth curve —
are therefore not stated here either.

which is smooth of pure relative dimension `d`, the exceptional inverse image of the constant
