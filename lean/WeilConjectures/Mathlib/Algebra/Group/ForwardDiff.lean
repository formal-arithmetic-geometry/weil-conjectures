# Functions on `ℕ` with polynomial forward differences

We show that a function `f : ℕ → ℚ` whose forward difference agrees with a polynomial of degree
`< d` on the naturals is itself given by a polynomial of degree `< d + 1`, and that the same holds
if only the differences with two coprime steps `a` and `a + 1` are polynomial. We also record a few
facts on polynomials which are eventually nonnegative on the naturals, and on the degree of the
difference `P (X + a) - P`.

## Main statements

- `Polynomial.exists_degree_lt_eval_eq_of_fwdDiff_iter_eq_zero`: a function on `ℕ` whose
  `(d + 1)`-st forward difference vanishes is a polynomial of degree `< d + 1` (Newton series).
- `Polynomial.exists_degree_lt_eval_eq_of_sub`: a function on `ℕ` whose forward difference is a
  polynomial of degree `< d` is a polynomial of degree `< d + 1`.
- `Polynomial.exists_degree_lt_eval_eq_of_sub_of_sub`: the same with steps `a` and `a + 1`.
- `Polynomial.leadingCoeff_nonneg_of_eventually_nonneg`,
  `Polynomial.degree_le_degree_add_of_eventually_nonneg`: eventually nonnegative polynomials.
- `Polynomial.degree_add_one_le_of_le_degree_comp_sub`: the difference `P (X + a) - P` has
  degree smaller than `P`.
