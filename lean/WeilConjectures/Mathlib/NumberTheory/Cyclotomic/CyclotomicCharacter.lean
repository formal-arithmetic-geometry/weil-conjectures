# The cyclotomic character of a power of Frobenius

Let `K` be an algebraically closed field of characteristic `p`, let `q = p ^ a`, and let `ℓ ≠ p`
be a prime. The `ℓ`-adic cyclotomic character records the scalar in `ℤ_ℓˣ` by which a ring
automorphism of `K` acts on the cyclotomic Tate module `ℤ_ℓ(1)`, because the automorphism acts on
each group of `ℓ^n`-th roots of unity by raising to that power.

The `q`-power (arithmetic) Frobenius `σ : x ↦ x ^ q` raises every root of unity to the `q`-th
power, so it acts on `ℤ_ℓ(1)` as multiplication by `q`. Consequently the geometric Frobenius
`F = σ⁻¹` acts as multiplication by `q⁻¹`, which is a genuine unit of `ℤ_ℓ` precisely because
`ℓ ∤ q`; this is a formal consequence of the first statement, since the cyclotomic character is a
homomorphism into `ℤ_ℓˣ`. The same formulas describe the action on the localisation
`ℚ_ℓ(1) = ℤ_ℓ(1)[1/ℓ]`, since that action is obtained from the one on `ℤ_ℓ(1)` by extension of
scalars.

## Main declarations

* `cyclotomicCharacter_frobeniusEquiv_pow`: the `q = p ^ a` power Frobenius acts on `ℤ_ℓ(1)` by
  the scalar `q`.
* `cyclotomicCharacter_frobeniusEquiv_pow_inv_mul`: the geometric Frobenius acts by the inverse
  scalar `q⁻¹`, a unit of `ℤ_ℓ`.

## Blueprint

`cyclotomicCharacter_frobeniusEquiv_pow` and `cyclotomicCharacter_frobeniusEquiv_pow_inv_mul`
implement `sk-p-cyclotomic`.
