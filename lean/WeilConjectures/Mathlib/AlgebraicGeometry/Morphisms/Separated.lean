# Complements on separated morphisms

This file collects complements on separated morphisms of schemes.

## The diagonal of a separated morphism locally of finite presentation

For a separated morphism the diagonal is a closed immersion. Combined with
`AlgebraicGeometry.locallyOfFinitePresentation_diagonal` this shows that the diagonal of a
separated morphism locally of finite presentation is a closed immersion of finite presentation
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.diagonal_isClosedImmersion_finitePresentation`).

## Separatedness from an open cover of the source

We prove the criterion of separatedness over an open cover (Stacks Project Tag 0F3U):
`w : W ⟶ S` is separated as soon as `W` has an open cover `𝒰` for which every overlap
morphism `𝒰ᵢ ×_W 𝒰ⱼ ⟶ 𝒰ᵢ ×_S 𝒰ⱼ` is a closed immersion
(`AlgebraicGeometry.IsSeparated.of_openCover`), together with its two-element special
case `AlgebraicGeometry.IsSeparated.of_two_open_cover`, in which the diagonal overlaps
are supplied by separatedness of `T₁ ⟶ S` and `T₂ ⟶ S`.

The proof covers `W ×_S W` by the chart opens `𝒰ᵢ ×_S 𝒰ⱼ` and identifies the
restriction of the diagonal over such a chart with the overlap morphism
(`AlgebraicGeometry.diagonalRestrictChartArrowIso`); over the diagonal charts that
morphism is the closed-immersion diagonal of `𝒰ᵢ ⟶ S`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.isClosedImmersion_pullback_map_self`), and the two mixed charts of
a two-element cover are exchanged by the symmetry isomorphism
(`AlgebraicGeometry.pullback_map_symmetry`).

## The affine criterion for separatedness

`AlgebraicGeometry.IsSeparatingPair X U V` says that `Γ(X, U ⊓ V)` is generated as a ring by
the images of the restriction maps from `Γ(X, U)` and `Γ(X, V)`. For affine `U`, `V` and `U ⊓ V`
this is equivalent to `U ⊓ V ⟶ U × V` being a closed immersion
(`AlgebraicGeometry.isSeparatingPair_iff`), which gives the classical criterion: a scheme all of
whose affine opens in some cover pairwise satisfy it (with affine intersections) is separated
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.isSeparated_of_isSeparatingPair`), and conversely
(`AlgebraicGeometry.isSeparatingPair_of_isSeparated`).

## Morphisms agreeing on a scheme-theoretically dominant subscheme

Two morphisms into a separated target that agree after precomposition with a
scheme-theoretically dominant morphism are equal
(`AlgebraicGeometry.ext_of_isSchemeTheoreticallyDominant_of_isSeparated` and its
version for morphisms over a base
`AlgebraicGeometry.ext_of_isSchemeTheoreticallyDominant_of_isSeparated'`). This is
the scheme-theoretic analogue of Mathlib's
`AlgebraicGeometry.ext_of_isDominant_of_isSeparated`, with the reducedness assumption
on the source dropped.
