# Tensor products of reduced algebras over a perfect field

Over a perfect field every reduced algebra is geometrically reduced, so the tensor product of two
reduced algebras is reduced: a product of reduced varieties is reduced.

The proof reduces to fields. A reduced ring `A` embeds coordinatewise into the product of its
residue fields, so `A ⊗[k] B` is reduced once every `κ(p) ⊗[k] B` is
(`isReduced_tensorProduct_of_forall_residueField`); applied on both sides this leaves
`K ⊗[k] L` for fields `K, L`. Reducing `L` to its finitely generated subfields, `L` has a
separating transcendence basis over the perfect field `k`: `L` is separable algebraic over a
purely transcendental extension `E`. Then `K ⊗[k] E` is a localization of a polynomial ring over
`K`, and `K ⊗[k] L` is obtained from it by an unramified base change, so it is reduced.

## Main results

- `isReduced_tensorProduct_of_forall_residueField`
- `isReduced_tensorProduct_of_field`
- `isReduced_tensorProduct_of_perfectField`

## Blueprint

- `sk-i-geometry`: products of reduced varieties over a perfect field are reduced.

/-- If `A` is reduced and `κ(p) ⊗[k] B` is reduced for every prime `p` of `A`, then `A ⊗[k] B` is
reduced: a nilpotent element of `A ⊗[k] B` vanishes in every `κ(p) ⊗[k] B`, and these maps are
jointly injective since the primes of `A` intersect to `0`. -/
