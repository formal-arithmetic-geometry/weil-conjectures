# The Nullstellensatz for finitely generated algebras

Let `A` be a finitely generated algebra over an algebraically closed field `k`. Every maximal ideal
of `A` is the kernel of a `k`-algebra map `A →ₐ[k] k`, i.e. closed points of `Spec A` have residue
field `k`; and an element of `A` vanishing at every `k`-point is nilpotent.

## Main results

- `exists_algHom_ker_eq_of_isMaximal`: maximal ideals are kernels of `k`-points.
- `iInf_ker_algHom_eq_nilradical`: the vanishing principle.
- `eq_zero_of_forall_algHom_apply_eq_zero`: the vanishing principle on a reduced algebra.
- `existsUnique_comp_mkₐ_eq_of_forall_algHom`: a regular map sending `k`-points into a closed
  subvariety factors through it.
- `Algebra.TensorProduct.eq_zero_of_forall_lift_algHom_eq_zero`: the vanishing principle on a
  product of affine varieties.

## Blueprint

- `sk-i-geometry`: the Nullstellensatz and the vanishing principle.
- `lem-wf-affine-nullstellensatz-vanishing`: residue fields of closed points and the vanishing
  principle.
- `lem-wf-affine-product-reduced`: the vanishing principle on a product of reduced affine
  varieties. Its reducedness clause holds over any perfect field, see
  `isReduced_tensorProduct_of_perfectField`.

/-- Blueprint `lem-wf-affine-nullstellensatz-vanishing`, clause (3): let `f : B →ₐ[k] A` be the
coordinate map of a regular map `X → Y` of affine varieties over an algebraically closed field `k`,
with `A` reduced and finitely generated, and let `J` be an ideal of `B` (cutting out `Z ⊆ Y`). If
every `k`-point of `X` maps into `Z`, i.e. `φ (f b) = 0` for every `k`-point `φ` of `X` and
`b ∈ J`, then `f` factors uniquely through `B ⧸ J`.

Each `f b` with `b ∈ J` vanishes at every `k`-point, so it is zero by the vanishing principle
`eq_zero_of_forall_algHom_apply_eq_zero`; uniqueness holds as `B → B ⧸ J` is surjective. -/

/-- Blueprint `lem-wf-affine-product-reduced`: let `A` and `B` be reduced finitely generated
algebras over an algebraically closed field `k`, the coordinate algebras of affine varieties `X`
and `Y`. The `k`-points of `X × Y = Spec (A ⊗[k] B)` are the pairs `(φ, ψ)` of `k`-points, and a
function on `X × Y` vanishing at all of them is zero.

Evaluating the first factor at a `k`-point `φ` of `X` sends `t` to a function on `Y`, which
vanishes at every `k`-point of `Y` and hence is zero by the vanishing principle for `B`. As the
evaluations at `k`-points of `X` are jointly injective on `A` (the vanishing principle for `A`),
`t = 0` by `TensorProduct.eq_zero_of_forall_rTensor_eq_zero`. In particular `A ⊗[k] B` is reduced,
which holds more generally over a perfect field (`isReduced_tensorProduct_of_perfectField`). -/
