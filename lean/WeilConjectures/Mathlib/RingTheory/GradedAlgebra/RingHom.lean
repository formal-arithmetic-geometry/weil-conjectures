# The graded components of a graded ring homomorphism

We define `GradedRingHom.gradeZeroRingHom`, the degree-zero component of a graded ring
homomorphism as a ring homomorphism between the degree-zero subrings, and we show that a
surjective graded ring homomorphism is surjective in each degree separately.

/-- A surjective graded ring homomorphism is surjective in each degree: an element of `ℬ i`
is the image of an element of `𝒜 i`.

Any preimage works after replacing it by its degree-`i` component, since taking graded
components commutes with a graded ring homomorphism. -/
