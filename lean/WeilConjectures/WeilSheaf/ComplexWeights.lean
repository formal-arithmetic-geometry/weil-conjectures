# Upper weight bounds of Weil complexes

The blueprint definition `def-weil-complex-weights` has two halves. A Weil complex `K` on a
`k₀`-scheme `Y` has *weights at most* `w` if every cohomology sheaf `𝓗ʲK` is `ι`-mixed of
weights at most `w + j`; it has *weights at least* `w` if its Verdier dual `D_Y K` has weights
at most `-w`. The upper half is `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilComplex.IsMixedOfWeightsAtMost`
(`WeilConjectures.DeligneLaumon.Reduction.Weights`), with cohomological indexing so that the
bound in degree `j` is `w + j`; this file records that it is the upper half of the blueprint
definition and proves that shifting by `n` raises the bound by `n`.

The lower half is not formalised. It needs, at the level of Weil complexes, the dualizing Weil
complex `ω_Y` (the exceptional inverse image `Ra_Y^! ℚ̄_ℓ` with its canonical Weil structure)
and the derived internal hom `RHom(K, ω_Y)` with arbitrary, not necessarily lisse, first
argument. Neither exists for `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilComplex`: the exceptional inverse image and
the Verdier dual of `WeilConjectures.SixFunctors.ProEtale.Derived.Duality` live on the derived
category of pro-étale sheaves without Weil structure, and the only derived internal hom of Weil
complexes is `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilComplex.ihomLisse`, out of a lisse Weil sheaf.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilComplex.isMixedOfWeightsAtMost_iff`: the upper half of
  `def-weil-complex-weights`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilComplex.isMixedOfWeightsAtMost_shift_iff`: shifts.

/-- *Weights at most `w` of a Weil complex.* A Weil complex `K` has weights at most `w` if and
only if for every `j ∈ ℤ` its cohomology sheaf `𝓗ʲK` is `ι`-mixed of weights at most `w + j`.
This is the upper half of the blueprint definition; its lower half, through the Verdier dual,
is not available for Weil complexes (see the module docstring).
