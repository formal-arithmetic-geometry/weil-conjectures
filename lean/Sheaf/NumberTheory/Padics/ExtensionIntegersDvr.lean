/-- The sets of elements of absolute value at most one and less than one in a finite
extension of `ℚ_[l]` form its ring of integers and maximal ideal. The ring is a DVR with
finite residue field. Uniformizers attain the largest nonzero value in the maximal ideal,
exist, and differ by units; every nonzero field element has a unique unit-times-integer-power
expression for a fixed uniformizer.

(blueprint: lem-weil-l-adic-extension-integers-dvr)

Proof: (1) By lem-weil-l-adic-extension-absolute-value the extending absolute value is
nonarchimedean. Equip `E` with its normed and valued field structures. The finite-dimensional
properness theorem lem-weil-l-adic-extension-proper, applied over the proper field `ℚ_[l]`,
makes `E` proper. (2) Apply lem-weil-l-adic-extension-dvr-finite-residue to obtain the DVR
and finite residue field. Its integer ring and maximal ideal have exactly the indicated
membership conditions. (3) The ultrametric inequality and multiplicativity give subring
and ideal closure. An integer is a unit exactly when its value is one, by considering its
inverse. Thus the ideal is the unique maximal ideal; every field element or its inverse
is integral, giving the fraction field. (4) Choose a generator of the nonzero maximal ideal
using def-sc-discrete-valuation-ring. By lem-weil-pbc-dvr-unit-times-uniformizer-power every
nonzero integer is a unit times a nonnegative power of this generator. Units have value one,
so the nonzero values in the maximal ideal are its value to positive integer powers. The
largest is its value; an integer generates the ideal precisely when its exponent is one.
Writing a nonzero field element as a quotient of integers gives an integer exponent.
Comparison of absolute values gives uniqueness of the exponent, and cancellation gives
uniqueness of the unit. In particular, any two generators differ by a unit. -/
