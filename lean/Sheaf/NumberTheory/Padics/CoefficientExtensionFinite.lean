# Finiteness interface for finite p-adic coefficient extensions

Source: Weil blueprint, `def-weil-finite-field-fiber`, order 411;
Serre, Local Fields, Chapter II, §2
(blueprint: def-weil-l-adic-coefficient-extension).

The coefficient constructions are imported unchanged; this supplies their finite-ring
interface at positive levels.

/-- The coefficient ring at a finite level is finite.

Source: Weil conjectures blueprint, node `def-weil-finite-field-fiber`,
order 411; Serre, Local Fields, Chapter II, §2
(blueprint: def-weil-l-adic-coefficient-extension).

Proof: Apply `Padic.extension_integers_dvr` to the spectral absolute value to obtain
that the recorded integer ring is a DVR with finite residue field. Its recorded
uniformizer generates the recorded maximal ideal. Thus the ideal defining the level
`n` ring is the `n`th power of that maximal ideal. Each successive ideal quotient
is a finite-dimensional vector space over the finite residue field, and induction
on `n` gives the finiteness of the ring quotient. Equivalently apply
`Ideal.finite_quotient_pow` in the Noetherian integer ring after identifying ideals.
