Let `X` be a topological space with a basis of quasi-compact open subsets, and let
`E` and `E'` be constructible subsets of `X`.  Their intersection, regarded as a
subset of the subspace `E`, is constructible in `E` (Stacks, Tag 09YI).

Proof, following the four steps of the node:
1. By `lem-weil-pbc-constructible-is-retrocompact` (Tag 09YH), `E` is retrocompact:
   its intersection with every quasi-compact open of `X` is quasi-compact.
2. Every quasi-compact open `W` of `E` is `E ∩ W'` for a quasi-compact open `W'`
   of `X`: write `W = E ∩ O` with `O` open, cover `O` by quasi-compact basis opens,
   and take a finite subcover of `W`. Their finite union is the required `W'`.
   Compactness in the subspace agrees with compactness of its image in `X`.
3. If `V` is retrocompact open in `X`, then `V ∩ E` is retrocompact open in `E`:
   for `W = E ∩ W'` as in step 2, `V ∩ W'` is quasi-compact open in `X`, so
   `E ∩ (V ∩ W')` is quasi-compact by step 1. These are the details of Tag 09YF.
4. The inclusion `E → X` is continuous and pulls retrocompact opens back to
   retrocompact opens by step 3. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-constructible-preimage`,
   Mathlib's `IsConstructible.preimage` (Tag 005I), to `E'`. Its preimage is exactly
   the trace `E ∩ E'` in `E`.
