The termwise skyscraper of a complex of stalk modules recovers that complex on taking
its stalk at the same point, and carries acyclic complexes to acyclic sheaf complexes.

Proof: for each open U and degree i, skyscraper sections are M^i if x belongs to U and
zero otherwise, with the original differential or the zero map. If M is acyclic, the
sequence of sections in degrees i-1, i, i+1 is therefore exact for every U, and hence
is exact as a sequence of sheaves. This proves acyclicity in every degree, using
`def-pc-cochain-complex-modules` and `def-pc-acyclic-complex-modules`.
For stalk recovery, the neighbourhood diagram at x has the constant value M^i and
identity transition maps in each degree. Its colimit is M^i. These identifications
commute with the differentials and respect the stalk scalar action because section
scalars act through germs. They assemble to the asserted module complex isomorphism,
using `def-pc-cochain-complex-modules`. No separation assumption on x or X is needed. -/
