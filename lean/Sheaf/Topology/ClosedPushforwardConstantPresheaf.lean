/-- The presheaf of locally constant maps on intersections with a closed subset, with
restriction of functions. The subtypes carry their subspace topologies.

(blueprint: def-weil-pbc-closed-pushforward-constant-presheaf).
The construction makes sense for every subset; closedness is needed for the off-subset
stalk assertion, rather than for defining the section presheaf. -/
