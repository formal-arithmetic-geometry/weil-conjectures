/-! # Cohomology of modules on a ringed space

Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology, Section 20.11, Tag 01DZ
(blueprint: def-sc-ringed-space-module-cohomology).

For a ringed space `X` and an `O_X`-module `F` (an object of
`SheafOfModules (moduleRings X)`), `H^p(X, F)` is the `p`-th right derived functor of the
global sections functor `Γ(X, -) : Mod(O_X) ⥤ Mod_{O_X(X)}`, computed in the category of
`O_X`-modules. This is the declaration later nodes about cohomology of `O_X`-modules on a
ringed space cite.

## Main definitions and statements

- `globalSectionsFunctor`: `Γ(X, -)` on `O_X`-modules, valued in `O_X(X)`-modules; the
  ringed-space analogue of `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.globalSectionsFunctor`.
- `moduleCohomology`: `H^p(X, -) := R^p Γ(X, -)` (`Functor.rightDerived`).
- `globalSectionsComplex`: global sections of a chosen injective resolution.
- `moduleCohomology_iso_resolution`: `H^p(X, F) ≅ H^p(Γ(X, I^•))` for every injective
  resolution `F[0] → I^•`.
- `moduleCohomology_independent`: the cohomology of `Γ(X, I^•)` does not depend on `I^•`.

## Implementation notes

Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Sheaf.H` (`TopCat.Sheaf` cohomology) is an `Ext`-group from the
constant sheaf `ℤ` in *abelian* sheaves, i.e. derived functors of `Γ` on `Ab(X)`; it has no
`O_X(X)`-module structure and is not computed in `Mod(O_X)`. The source's
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.H` applies it to the underlying abelian sheaf of a module on
a scheme. Both agree with `moduleCohomology` only through the theorem that injective
`O_X`-modules are `Γ`-acyclic as abelian sheaves (Stacks, Tag 01E3); here the definition is
the source's, in `Mod(O_X)`.

Proof: Enough injectives is supplied by
`lem-sc-ringed-space-module-sheaves-enough-injectives`. By `def-sp-left-exact-additive`,
the right derived functor is formed by applying the additive global-sections functor
to a chosen injective resolution and taking degree `p` homology. Compare that resolution
with `I` using `def-sp-injective-resolutions`: the comparison maps extending the identity
of `F` are a homotopy equivalence, which the additive functor `Γ(X, -)` preserves, hence
an isomorphism on degree-`p` homology. Mathlib's `InjectiveResolution.isoRightDerivedObj`
is this comparison. -/

/-- The cohomology of `Γ(X, I^•)` is independent, up to isomorphism, of the chosen injective
resolution. Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology, Section 20.11, Tag 01DZ
(blueprint: def-sc-ringed-space-module-cohomology).

Proof: In the abelian module-sheaf category
(`lem-sc-ringed-space-module-sheaves-enough-injectives`), the two injective resolutions
(`def-sp-injective-resolutions`) are homotopy equivalent by comparison maps extending
the identity of `F`. The additive global-sections functor preserves that homotopy
equivalence. Taking degree `p` homology yields inverse isomorphisms; this is the
resolution-independence construction for `def-sp-left-exact-additive`. -/
