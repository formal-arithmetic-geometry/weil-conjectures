/-- For every topological space, its Krull dimension is the supremum of its local dimensions.

Source: Stacks Project, Topology, Lemma Tag 0B7I.
Proof:
1. Taking the whole space as an open neighbourhood in the minimum defining local dimension
   (`def-kun-topological-dimension-at-point`) gives `dim_x X ≤ dim X`; taking the supremum
   gives the first inequality. The self-subspace is the original space
   (`def-kun-subspace-topology`).
2. For the converse, the empty space has dimension and empty supremum equal to bottom.
   Otherwise, global dimension is the supremum of lengths of strict chains of irreducible
   closed subsets (`def-kun-topological-krull-dimension`); it suffices to bound each length
   `n ≥ 0` by some local dimension.
3. For a chain `Z₀ ⊊ ... ⊊ Zₙ`, choose `x ∈ Z₀`, which is nonempty by irreducibility
   (`def-weil-irreducible-components`). Every open neighbourhood `U` of `x`, with its subspace
   topology (`def-kun-subspace-topology`), meets each `Zᵢ`. The open-subspace correspondence
   (`lem-weil-pbc-open-subspace-irreducible-closed-correspondence`) makes `Zᵢ ∩ U` irreducible
   closed in `U` and preserves strict inclusions: their closures in `X` are the original `Zᵢ`.
   Thus `dim U ≥ n` by `def-kun-topological-krull-dimension`.
4. Taking the minimum over these neighbourhoods (`def-kun-topological-dimension-at-point`)
   gives `dim_x X ≥ n`. Taking the supremum over chain lengths gives the reverse inequality,
   hence equality. (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-dimension-supremum-local-dimensions)
