/-- Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology, Proposition 02UZ, final induction step.
(blueprint: new-node-irreducible-open-complement-dimension).

Proof: the complement Z is a proper closed subset because U is nonempty. A chain of
nonempty irreducible closed subsets of Z maps to such a chain in X, since Z is closed.
Appending the irreducible closed subset X strictly extends the chain. Thus every chain
of length n in Z gives a chain of length n+1 in X. If d=0, Z has no nonempty irreducible
closed subsets; the closure of any point would be one, so Z is empty. If d>0, the same
chain bound gives dimension Z at most d-1, and e=d-1 is strictly less than d. This
argument does not require separation, sobriety or Noetherianity. -/
