/-- (blueprint: lem-exc-coinduced-functions-open-stabilizer) A continuous map from a profinite
group to a discrete space is invariant under right multiplication by some open normal subgroup.

Step 1: each fibre of `f` is open, and the fibres cover compact `G`. For every `x`, the
open-subgroup neighbourhood basis at one (from the finite discrete quotients of a profinite
group) gives an open subgroup `V x` with `x * V x` in the fibre of `f x`. A finite collection
of these cosets covers `G`; the intersection `V` of their subgroups is open and satisfies
`f (x * v) = f x` for all `x` and `v ∈ V`.

Step 2: an open subgroup of compact `G` has finite index. Intersecting the finitely many
conjugates of `V` over representatives of `G / V` gives an open normal subgroup `U ⊆ V`, and
the same right-invariance holds for `U`.
