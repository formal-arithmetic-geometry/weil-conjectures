/-- First-order polynomial coordinates of a formally smooth augmented algebra are
coordinates at every finite order.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 05D5, induction constructing the inverse σₙ of Ψₙ.
(blueprint: lem-sbc-formally-smooth-augmentation-truncations)

Proof: Put I = ker ε and J = the variables ideal. Bijectivity at degree two identifies
I/I² with the span of the coordinate images over B. Multiplying representatives shows
that products of k coordinate images span Iᵏ/Iᵏ⁺¹. Induction, starting with degree two
(and its degree-one quotient), therefore makes every induced map fₖ surjective.
Degree zero has zero source and target. For k ≥ 2, assume fₖ is invertible. Formal
smoothness lifts the map C → C/Iᵏ → B[X]/Jᵏ across B[X]/Jᵏ⁺¹ → B[X]/Jᵏ; its kernel
is square-zero since 2k ≥ k+1. The lift sends I into J/Jᵏ⁺¹, since its degree-one
reduction is the inverse augmentation map, and hence kills Iᵏ⁺¹. Compose its descended
map with fₖ₊₁. Each variable becomes Xᵢ + δᵢ with δᵢ in Jᵏ/Jᵏ⁺¹. Substitution
Xᵢ ↦ Xᵢ - δᵢ is the inverse: substituting a correction into a monomial of degree k
changes it by terms of degree at least 2k-1 ≥ k+1. Thus this composite is invertible,
so fₖ₊₁ is injective as well as surjective. This completes induction. Rank zero works
with the same argument and empty sums. Neither locality nor Noetherianity is needed. -/
