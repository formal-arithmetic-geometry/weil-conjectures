/-- Sufficiently deep local maximal-ideal reductions detect any fixed tensor quotient.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 07N9, using Tags 00JA, 00CT and 0394.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-local-tensor-quotient-detection)

Proof: Put A = R_p and B = A tensor_R S, a finite Noetherian A-algebra. For fixed n > 0,
B/m^n B is Artinian, and its canonical product decomposition into its localizations
at maximal ideals is an isomorphism (Tags 00JA and 00CT). These maximal ideals correspond
to primes q of S over p, and the factors are S_q/m^n S_q. There are finitely many q.
In each S_q the ideal m S_q has radical its maximal ideal N_q, since the special fibre
is a finite-dimensional local algebra over the residue field of A. Noetherianity gives
a positive c_q with N_q^{c_q} contained in m S_q. Choose k at least n and at least
n c_q for every q. Then N_q^k is contained in m^n S_q for all q. The assumed vanishings
therefore kill the image of the finite sum in every factor of B/m^n B; injectivity of
the product decomposition kills the sum itself. Identify B/m^n B with
(A/m^n) tensor_R S to obtain the conclusion. For n = 0 the conclusion lies in the zero
quotient, so take k = 0. If there are no q, the product and the Artinian quotient are
zero. Empty sums also satisfy the conclusion. -/
