/-- Over a Noetherian base the specified equations are regular at every polynomial prime
containing their ideal.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 00SV, first paragraph of the proof.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-relative-ci-noetherian-local-regular-sequence).

Proof: Put `P = R[x]`, `p = Q ∩ R`, and `B = P_Q`. The polynomial ring is free over `R`
and Noetherian, so the canonical map `R_p → B` is flat and local between Noetherian local
rings. Polynomial scalar extension identifies the polynomial fibre with `κ(p)[x]`.
The fibre-prime correspondence gives a prime over `Q`; since `Q` contains the equations,
the induced quotient fibre is nonzero. Base change (00SS) preserves the specified relative
complete-intersection presentation, hence its dimension is `n-c`, with `c ≤ n`.
Apply the field-case local regular-sequence lemma (00SC) at this fibre prime. The natural
fibre-local-ring isomorphism identifies its localized polynomial ring with the closed
fibre of `R_p → B`, and sends each displayed equation to its closed-fibre image.
Transport regularity through this isomorphism and apply the flat closed-fibre lifting
lemma (00MG). Its regularity conclusion is the assertion here. For `c=0`, all lists are
empty and `B` is nonzero because `Q` is prime. The zero quotient has no such prime `Q`.
