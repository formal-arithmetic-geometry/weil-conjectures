/-- A prime has a closed point above it after an algebraically closed scalar extension,
with the same differential-fibre dimension. No smoothness or dimension bound is assumed.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, proof of Tag 00TT, the construction of the maximal ideal
and the differential base change of Tag 00RV.
(blueprint: new-algclosed-differential-fiber-at-closed-point).

Proof: Set κ = κ(q) and let K be its algebraic closure, regarded as a k-algebra through
k → S → κ → K. The tensor-product universal property gives the K-algebra map
φ : K ⊗[k] S → K with φ(λ ⊗ s) = λ ψ(s̄), where ψ : κ → K is the field embedding.
It is surjective, since φ(λ ⊗ 1) = λ, so its kernel is maximal. Injectivity of ψ and
ker(S → κ) = q show that this kernel contracts to q. Its residue field is K as a
K-algebra: the quotient is K and localizing this field changes nothing. Differential
base change identifies Ω[(K ⊗[k] S)/K] with (K ⊗[k] S) ⊗[S] Ω[S/k]. Tensoring this
isomorphism with the residue field gives K ⊗[S] Ω[S/k]. Tensor associativity identifies
this with K ⊗[κ] (κ ⊗[S] Ω[S/k]). A basis of the latter κ-vector space extends to a
basis over K, so its finrank is unchanged. These identifications prove the equality.
The witness K lives in Type (max u v), since κ does. -/
