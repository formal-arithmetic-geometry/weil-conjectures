/-- The cotangent dimension formula at a finite type algebra prime with separable residue field.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, proof of Lemma Tag 00TV, lines 38754--38778.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-regular-local-fibre-finrank).
Proof:
1. Set R = S_q, m its maximal ideal, and K = kappa(q). Finite type over the field k
   makes S and R Noetherian, and K is finitely generated as a field over k by the
   residue classes of algebra generators of S. The prime hypothesis makes K a field.
2. The quotient conormal sequence for R -> K is right exact. Separability and finite
   field generation give injectivity of m/m^2 -> K tensor_R Omega[R/k] by Tag 00TU.
   Identify the quotient conormal module with the local cotangent space using
   ker(R -> K) = m. Thus this sequence is short exact over K.
3. The cotangent space is finite dimensional since m is finitely generated. The
   separably generated differentials theorem makes Omega[K/k] finite dimensional,
   with dimension t = trdeg_k K. Additivity of dimensions in the short exact sequence
   gives finrank_K(K tensor_R Omega[R/k]) = e + t, where e = dim_K(m/m^2).
4. Localization of differentials identifies Omega[R/k] with R tensor_S Omega[S/k].
   Tensor associativity and cancellation of base change identify its K fibre with
   K tensor_S Omega[S/k], preserving the finite dimension e + t.
5. The dimension-at-point theorem gives finite natural numbers d and t with
   ringKrullDim R = d and topologicalKrullDimAt q = d + t. The regular-local
   cotangent criterion says R is regular if and only if e = d.
6. All dimensions are finite, so equality of their casts in WithBot ENat is equality
   of natural numbers. Cancel t in e + t = d + t to obtain e = d, in both directions.
