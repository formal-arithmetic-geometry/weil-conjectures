/-- An equivalence identifying two ideals induces an equivalence of their completions,
compatible with the canonical completion maps.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Definition 07GH and Proposition 07PV,
the invariance under a quotient presentation.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-adic-completion-ring-equiv).

Proof: On each quotient use Ideal.quotientEquiv, which is bijective. Apply the
proved quotient-power comparison RingTheory.pair_henselization_completion_data
to the original ring map. Its inverse compatibility, after applying the completion
equivalence, is precisely the required forward compatibility. This works for the
zero and unit ideals and requires no Noetherian hypothesis. -/
