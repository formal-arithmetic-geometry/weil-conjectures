/-- The equations are regular in the closed fibre of the polynomial local map, before
lifting regularity to the polynomial local ring itself.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 00SV, first paragraph of the proof, using 00SC.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-relative-ci-closed-fiber-regular-sequence).

Proof: Put `P = R[x]` and contract `Q` to `p` in `R`. The fibre-prime correspondence
provides a prime of `κ(p) ⊗[R] P` contracting to `Q`. Polynomial scalar extension
identifies this fibre ring with `κ(p)[x]`, taking each equation to its coefficientwise
residue-field image. The corresponding prime contains these images, so the quotient
by their ideal is nonzero. Base change (00SS) preserves the specified relative complete
intersection, and its only nonempty fibre over the field `κ(p)` has dimension `n-c`,
with `c ≤ n`. Equivalently its dimension plus `c` is `n`. Apply the field-case theorem
00SC to obtain regularity at the corresponding polynomial fibre prime. The natural
fibre-local-ring isomorphism (0H9M) identifies this ring with the closed fibre of the
map `R_p → P_Q`. Indeed the extended maximal ideal of `R_p` equals the extension of
`p`, since the denominators in `R \ p` become units. The isomorphism carries each
closed-fibre equation to the equation used in 00SC; transport regularity through it.
For no equations the fibre local ring is still nonzero; if the original quotient is
zero no prime containing all equations exists. No Noetherian hypothesis is needed for
this identification and field-case argument.
