/-- A resolution over a smooth finitely presented auxiliary base gives a resolution over
`k`, provided the original extended singular ideal is contained in the auxiliary one.

Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps, proof of Lemma 07FE, the passage from
`R = k[x]` back to `k` (step 8 of the repaired proof).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-resolution-smooth-base).

Proof: write the resolution over `R` as `C → D → Λ`. Finite presentation is transitive,
so `D` is finitely presented over `k`. Every smooth principal localization of `D` over
`R` is smooth over `k`, by composition with the smooth map `k → R`. Taking spans,
radicals, images and radicals again gives `h_D^R ≤ h_D^k`. Thus `h_D^k` escapes `q`.
Compose `A → C → D`; its composite to `Λ` is the original map. The assumed containment
and the resolution give `h_A^k ≤ h_C^R ≤ h_D^R ≤ h_D^k`, as required. -/
