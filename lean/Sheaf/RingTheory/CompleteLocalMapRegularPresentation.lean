/-- Every local map of complete Noetherian local rings has compatible regular presentations.

Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Lemma 07NN, statement and proof
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-complete-local-map-regular-presentation).

Proof:
1. Apply lem-weil-pbc-cohen-power-series-presentation to A and B to obtain surjective local
   maps q : R → A and v₀ : S₀ → B from complete regular power series rings. The residue fields
   have the same characteristic because f induces a field homomorphism. The coefficient ring
   of R has residue field A/m_A, so q induces the required residue-field isomorphism.
2. By lem-weil-pbc-field-cohen-power-series-formally-smooth, R is adically formally smooth
   over the integers. The kernel J of v₀ lies in m_S₀ and is closed, since
   lem-weil-pbc-complete-local-quotient makes S₀/J separated. The map fq is continuous and
   lem-weil-pbc-fs-adic-lift-into-complete lifts it to φ : R → S₀. Its bound on maximal ideals
   makes φ local (equivalently, use locality of fq and the preimage of m_B under v₀).
3. Set S = S₀[[y₁, …, yₙ]] using def-weil-pbc-multivariate-power-series. Grouping variables
   and lem-weil-pbc-power-series-field-cohen-regular-complete make S complete regular local.
   Evaluation at y = 0 followed by v₀ gives a surjective local v, by
   lem-weil-pbc-power-series-quotient-variables. By lem-weil-pbc-power-series-adic-evaluation,
   define u with the coefficient map of φ and u(xᵢ) = φ(xᵢ) + yᵢ. Images of the generators of
   m_R lie in m_S (including p in the Cohen case), so u is local. Uniqueness of evaluation
   into complete B gives vu = fq, since these maps agree on coefficients and variables.
4. Put aᵢ = φ(xᵢ) ∈ m_S₀. The substitutions yᵢ ↦ aᵢ + yᵢ and yᵢ ↦ yᵢ - aᵢ are inverse
   continuous automorphisms by lem-weil-pbc-power-series-adic-evaluation and its uniqueness.
   Apply the first to the standard parameters of S, given by
   lem-weil-pbc-power-series-field-cohen-regular-complete. The resulting system contains all
   u(xᵢ), and also u(p) = p in the Cohen case. Thus the parameters of R extend to those of S.
5. Reorder that system to put the images of the parameters of R first. They are a regular
   sequence by lem-weil-pbc-regular-local-generators-regular-sequence. Therefore
   lem-weil-pbc-flat-over-regular proves that u is flat.
6. Those images generate m_R S. The quotient clause of
   lem-weil-pbc-regular-local-generators-regular-sequence shows that S/m_R S is regular
   local. When d = 0 the ideal is zero and the quotient is S. -/
