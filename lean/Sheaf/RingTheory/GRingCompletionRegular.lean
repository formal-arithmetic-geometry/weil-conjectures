/-- The canonical map from a G-ring to its completion along any ideal is regular.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Lemma Tag 0AH2
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-g-ring-completion-regular).

Proof:
1. The G-ring hypothesis gives Noetherianity (`def-weil-pbc-g-ring`). The completion is
   Noetherian (`lem-weil-pbc-adic-completion-noetherian`), and its canonical map is flat
   (`lem-weil-pbc-noetherian-completion-flat`). The ideal is finitely generated.
2. By `lem-weil-pbc-regular-local-maximal`, it suffices to check regularity after localizing
   at every maximal ideal m' of the completion. Write m for its inverse image and B for
   the localization at m' (`def-weil-pbc-localization-at-prime`).
3. The projection to A/I is surjective with kernel I times the completion, and the
   completion is complete for that extended ideal (`lem-weil-pbc-adic-completion-mod-ideal`).
   That ideal lies in m' by `lem-weil-pbc-adic-complete-jacobson-radical`.
4. Every element b of the completion has a representative a in A modulo the projection's
   kernel. If b lies in m', then so does the image of a; since I lies in m, this proves
   m' is the extension of m. The same representatives give surjectivity on the residue
   fields of A_m and B; injectivity follows from locality.
5. The localized map φ from A_m to B is flat and local between Noetherian local rings
   (`lem-weil-pbc-flat-local-ring-maps`). Mapping the equality of step 4 into B shows
   that φ extends the maximal ideal of A_m to the maximal ideal of B
   (`def-weil-pbc-localization-at-prime`).
6. The localized map induces an isomorphism e between the maximal-ideal-adic completions
   of A_m and B, commuting with their canonical maps
   (`lem-weil-pbc-flat-local-completion-iso`, `def-weil-pbc-adic-completion`).
7. Compose B's completion map with e⁻¹ to obtain g : B → completion(A_m). The commuting
   square in step 6 proves g ∘ φ is exactly the completion map of A_m. It is regular
   by `def-weil-pbc-g-ring`.
8. The map g is flat: B's completion map is flat and e⁻¹ is bijective. It is also local,
   as both factors are local homomorphisms. Therefore it is faithfully flat, and its
   spectrum map is surjective (`lem-weil-pbc-local-completion-faithfully-flat`).
9. Descend regularity to A_m to B by `lem-weil-pbc-regular-permanence`. As m' was arbitrary,
   step 2 proves regularity of the original completion map. -/
