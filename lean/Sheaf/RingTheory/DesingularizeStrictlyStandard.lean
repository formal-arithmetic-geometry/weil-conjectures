/-- Desingularization along a strictly standard element, Stacks Project, Lemma Tag 07CT.
Compatibility modulo the fourth power is tested on representatives: if the image of `a`
under the quotient map is represented by `d`, their images in the quotient of `Λ` agree.
Every quotient class has a representative, so this is exactly the commuting triangle.

Proof: (1) `D` is Noetherian by finite type over `R`
(`lem-weil-pbc-finite-type-algebra-noetherian`). Form `A' = A ⊗[R] D` and the map to `Λ`.
Finite presentation is preserved by base change
(`lem-weil-pbc-finite-presentation-base-change-composition`).
(2) The element remains strictly standard by `lem-weil-pbc-strictly-standard-base-change`.
The given quotient map induces the section for `A'` modulo the fourth power; the
annihilator condition on `Λ` is unchanged.
(3) Apply `lem-weil-pbc-popescu-desingularize` over `D` to obtain `B`, with
`aB ≤ H_{B/D}`, where `a` annihilates `Ann_D(π²)/Ann_D(π)`. Composition gives finite
presentation over `R` and the two compatible factorization maps.
(4) At an `R`-flat prime of `D`, the quotient of annihilators vanishes by
`lem-weil-pbc-annihilator-element-flat-base-change`. It is finite since `D` is Noetherian;
`lem-weil-pbc-finite-module-support-annihilator` shows `a` is not contained in that prime.
(5) A smooth prime is flat by `lem-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map-flat`, localization flatness
(`lem-weil-pbc-localization-flat`), and `lem-weil-pbc-flat-ring-map-comp`.
(6) Thus primes of `B` over the smooth locus of `D/R` are smooth for `B/D`.
The zero-locus/radical criterion (`lem-weil-pbc-zero-locus-eq-iff-radical-eq`) gives
`H_{D/R}B ≤ H_{B/D}`.
(7) Smooth base change and composition (`lem-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map-base-change-composition`)
make those primes smooth for `B/R`; the same radical criterion gives the second inclusion.
