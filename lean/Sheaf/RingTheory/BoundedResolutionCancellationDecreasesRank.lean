/-- A nonminimal bounded finite free resolution admits one rank-decreasing cancellation.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 00MT, as used in the proof of Tag 00OA.

Proof: Choose finite bases in degrees zero through `d`. If every matrix coefficient
of every differential under consideration belongs to the maximal ideal, expansion
in the source basis expresses each image as a sum of maximal-ideal multiples of
basis vectors. This contradicts `hnot`, so some coefficient lies outside that ideal
and is a unit. Extend the complex by zero to negative integer degrees and apply
`ChainComplex.exists_splitting_of_isUnit_entry` at this coefficient. Restrict the
complementary complex back to natural degrees. Its terms have the same bases except
in the two affected degrees, where their ranks decrease by one. All degrees above
`d` remain zero. The removed identity complex is contractible, so the complement
has zero positive homology. The augmentation vanishes on the removed summand: at
index zero this summand is a differential image; at larger indices the degree-zero
term is unchanged. Restrict the augmentation to the complement. It still induces
an isomorphism on degree-zero homology, since the removed summand has zero homology.
The finite free terms are projective, giving the claimed resolution `P'`.
A local ring is nontrivial and has invariant basis number, so finite basis sizes
are their `Module.finrank`. Both affected indices belong to `Fin (d + 1)`; the sum
therefore decreases by two, in particular strictly. This is a single cancellation,
not the iteration or the assertion that the resulting resolution is minimal.
