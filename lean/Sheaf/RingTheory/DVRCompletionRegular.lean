/-- The canonical maximal-ideal-adic completion map of a discrete valuation ring (a Noetherian
local domain of dimension one with principal maximal ideal, Stacks Algebra Tag 00PD; Mathlib's
`IsDiscreteValuationRing`) is regular if its fraction field has characteristic zero.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Proposition Tag 07PX, proof of (3) and (4), using
Algebra, Lemma Tag 00PD (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-dvr-completion-regular).

Proof:
1. The completion map is flat by Mathlib's Noetherian completion instance.
2. A nonzero prime of a DVR is maximal (the principal ideal domain theorem), hence
   equals its unique maximal ideal. Thus the primes are zero and the maximal ideal.
3. `isGeometricallyRegular_genericFiber_of_isDiscreteValuationRing_of_charZero`
   identifies the generic fibre with a field, using the completion-DVR theorem and
   the source library's fraction-field base-change lemma. Purely inseparable
   extensions in characteristic zero are trivial, so this fibre is geometrically regular.
4. `isGeometricallyRegular_closedFiber` identifies the closed fibre with the residue
   field as an algebra over itself, using the completion evaluation quotient and the
   quotient-tensor equivalence. Every field base change is again a field.
5. Combine flatness and the two fibres using the definition of a regular ring map. -/
