/-- Essential smoothness is preserved by extension of scalars.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tags 00DK and 00T4, used in Smoothing Ring Maps,
proof of Lemma 07FJ, item-eighth-resolve.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-essentially-smooth-base-change).

Proof: Present E as a localization S⁻¹P of a smooth R-algebra P. Transport the
P-algebra structure to E through this presentation. Smoothness of Q⊗_R P over Q
follows by smooth base change. Localization base change identifies Q⊗_R E as the
localization of Q⊗_R P at the image of S. The localization algebra equivalence,
restricted to Q, is the required essentially smooth presentation. -/
