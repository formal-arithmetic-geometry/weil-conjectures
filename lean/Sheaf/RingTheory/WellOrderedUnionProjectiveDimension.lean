/-- A well-ordered increasing union of submodules whose successive quotients have
projective resolutions of length at most `n` has a projective resolution of length at most `n`.
The predecessor union is represented by its submodule supremum and pulled back along the
inclusion of `F e` into `M`. For a least index this is the zero submodule.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma 0D1U
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-well-ordered-union-projective-dimension).

Proof: generalize the module, the index type and all filtration hypotheses before
induction on the length bound. At zero use the splitting/direct-sum base case
`hasProjectiveResolutionLE_of_wellOrderedUnion_zero`. At a successor use
`hasProjectiveResolutionLE_of_wellOrderedUnion_succ`, supplying the generalized
induction hypothesis. The successor obligation constructs a projective presentation,
filters its kernel, applies the induction hypothesis to that kernel and splices its
resolution with the presentation. These two obligations are stated separately;
the induction combining them is complete. -/
