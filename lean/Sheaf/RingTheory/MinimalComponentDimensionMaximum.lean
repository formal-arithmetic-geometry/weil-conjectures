/-- Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, proof of Tag 00P1, the prime-chain argument.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-minimal-component-dimension-maximum).
The maximum dimension of the minimal components through a prime is the sum of the
local-ring dimension and the residue transcendence degree. This is a ring-theoretic
statement, before identifying that maximum with topological dimension at the point.

Proof: The quotient S/p is a finite type domain with fraction field kappa(p).
Tag 00P0 identifies its dimension with r, and Tag 00OS says that every maximal
prime chain in S/p has length r. Fix one such chain; its lift starts at p.
The ring S is Noetherian, so the set J of minimal primes q below p is finite
and nonempty. Localization identifies these with the minimal primes of S_p.
For each q in J choose a saturated chain from q to p of greatest length s(q).
These lengths exist: all such chains have length at most d, by the prime
correspondence and dim S_p = d. Conversely, every chain in S_p can be extended
at its bottom to a minimal prime and at its top to p. The supremum defining d
is attained because its lengths are natural numbers bounded by d; consequently
max s(q) = d. Concatenate each chosen chain with the fixed chain above p.
The resulting chain is maximal in S/q: it starts at its zero prime, ends at a
maximal ideal, and no insertion is possible, including at the joining prime p.
By Tag 00OS its length is dim S/q, hence dim S/q = s(q) + r.
Thus every component dimension is at most d+r, and a q attaining s(q)=d gives
equality. No topological dimension-at-point formula is used in this argument. -/
