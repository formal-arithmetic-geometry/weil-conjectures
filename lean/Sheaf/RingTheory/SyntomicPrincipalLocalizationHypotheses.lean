/-- Principal localization outside the prime preserves the complete-intersection fibre hypothesis.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 00SY, first sentence of (3) ⇒ (2), and Tag 00SA.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-syntomic-principal-localization-hypotheses).

Proof: extend q to S_g; its contraction is q because no power of g lies in q. The local rings
S_q and (S_g)_{qS_g} and their residue fields are canonically isomorphic. The induced base
prime is unchanged. Tensoring S_g with the residue field of the base identifies its fibre with the
localization of the old fibre at 1 tensor g. Its canonical prime contracts to the old canonical
prime, since the maps to the residue fields commute. If h is the element in the fibre
hypothesis, its image remains outside the extended prime. Localizing this new fibre at h
is the localization of F_h at the image of 1 tensor g. This is a global complete intersection
by principal-localization stability (00SA); transport along the canonical algebra
isomorphisms proves the required fibre hypothesis. -/
