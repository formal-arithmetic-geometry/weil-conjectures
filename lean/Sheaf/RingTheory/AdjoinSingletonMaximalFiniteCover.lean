/-- The generator-in-maximal local calculation produces a finite domain cover whose
maximal localizations are analytically unramified and which has a normal principal open.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 0334, Step 5, lines 46137--46173 and the descent setup.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-monogenic-maximal-finite-cover).

Proof:
1. Contract `m` to `n` in `R`. The residue field at `m` is monogenic of finite type over
   the residue field at `n`, hence finite by Tag 00FV. Lift its monic minimal polynomial
   to `R_n[T]`, clear the finitely many coefficient denominators by one element outside
   `n`, and work over `R_s`. Its evaluation at `x` lies in `m`.
2. Take a finite splitting field of the lifted polynomial over `K` and let `R'` be the
   integral closure of `R_s` in that field. Tags 032U and 032R make `R'` finite over `R_s`;
   it is normal and Nagata by integral-closure normality and Tag 032T. All roots lie in
   `R'` because the polynomial is monic. The algebra `S' = R'[x]` is finite over `R_s[x]`,
   using the module generators of `R'`.
3. Set `A = R[x]_m` and `B = (R[x] ∖ m)⁻¹S'`. The element `s` is already invertible in
   `A`, so `B` is a finite injective `A`-algebra and a Noetherian domain. Every maximal
   ideal of `B` corresponds to a maximal ideal `m'` of `S'` over `m`, by integrality.
   Factoring the lifted polynomial gives a root `r ∈ R'` with `x - r ∈ m'`.
   Since `R'[x] = R'[x-r]`, the supplied local calculation makes `S'_{m'}`, and hence
   that maximal localization of `B`, analytically unramified.
4. Write the original fraction `x = b/a`, `a ≠ 0`. After inverting its image in `B`,
   `R'[x]` becomes `R'_a`; further localization remains normal. The image of `a` is
   nonzero since all maps are injective. This supplies the required normal principal open.
   No N-1 assertion or finite-extension descent is part of this lemma. -/
