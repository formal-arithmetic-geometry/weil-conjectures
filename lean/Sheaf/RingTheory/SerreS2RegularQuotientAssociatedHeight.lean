# Associated primes of a regular principal quotient in an S2 ring

/-- Associated primes of a quotient by a nonzerodivisor in an S2 Noetherian ring
have height at most one.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 031T, proof of (1), using only S2
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-serre-s2-regular-quotient-associated-height).

Proof: An associated prime p of R/bR contains b, since b annihilates the whole quotient.
Localization of associated primes (Tag 0310) makes the maximal ideal of A = R_p
associated to the localized quotient, canonically A/(b/1). Thus the associated-prime
depth bound (Tag 0BK4) bounds its depth by the dimension of A/m, which is zero.
The image of b is regular: if (b/1)(a/s) = 0, a multiplier outside p kills ba,
and regularity of b forces that multiplier to kill a. It lies in m and A is nonzero.
The regular-element depth formula (Tag 090R) therefore gives depth(A) = 1.
Condition S2 at p then gives min(2,height(p)) ≤ 1, which forces height(p) ≤ 1.
A unit b gives the zero quotient and no associated primes, so this edge case is vacuous.
No reducedness, domain property, or integral closedness is required. -/
