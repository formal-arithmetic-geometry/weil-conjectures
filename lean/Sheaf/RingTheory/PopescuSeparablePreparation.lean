/-- The positive-dimensional case admits an auxiliary polynomial-base problem with the
strict standardness and annihilator hypotheses needed for eighth-power lifting.

Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps, proof of Lemma 07FE, steps 3--7
of the repaired proof (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-separable-preparation).

Proof: the inputs give a positive dimension `d` and an exponent `n` such that the
localized `n`th power of `q` lies in the extension of `H_{A/k}` itself, not merely its
radical. Since `A` is Noetherian, choose generators `a_j` of `H_{A/k}`.
Let `R = k[x_1,...,x_d]`, and form the actual quotient
`B = A[x_i,z_ij]/(x_i^n - Σ_j z_ij a_j)`. This is finitely presented over `R`.
For each `a_j`, eliminating `z_ij` makes `B_(a_j)` a polynomial extension of the smooth
base change of `A_(a_j)`. In `B_(x_i)` the `a_j` generate the unit ideal, so this localization
is smooth as well (the empty family gives the zero localization).
Apply the improve-presentation lemma to obtain a finite-type algebra `C` with retraction
to `B`. Since `R` is Noetherian, `C` is finitely presented. Its localizations at all `a_j`
and `x_i` are smooth; those at `x_i` have free differentials. Choose a common positive `c`
such that all `x_i^c` are strictly standard, and put `e = 8c`.
The controlled-annihilator generator lemma, with the extended ideal `H_{A/k}Λ`, gives
parameters `π_i` in `Λ` whose `n`th powers lie in that ideal, which generate the maximal
ideal after localization, and whose first and second annihilators agree modulo the
previous `e`th powers. Write `π_i^n = Σ_j λ_ij α(a_j)`. Evaluation `x_i ↦ π_i`,
`z_ij ↦ λ_ij` kills the defining relations of `B`; compose its map with the retraction
`C → B` to get `γ`. The map `A → C` followed by `γ` is `α`. Smoothness of `C_(a_j)`
puts the image of every generator `a_j` in `H_{C/R}`, hence `h_A^k ≤ h_C^R`.
The `π_i` lie in `q`, since their localized images do and contraction of the localized
maximal ideal is `q`. The first/square annihilator equality is supplied directly by
the controlled-annihilator lemma; passage to powers is proved by the calling module. -/
