/-- An algebra equivalence carries the singular ideal into the singular ideal.
Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps, Definition 07C5
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-singular-ideal-map-equiv).
Proof: The equivalence identifies the principal localizations at a and its image, so
smoothness transfers. Thus it maps the span of smooth-localization elements into the
corresponding span. Mapping a radical is contained in the radical of its image. -/
