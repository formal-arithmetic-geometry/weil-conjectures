/-- Let `R → S` be a map of commutative rings and `n` an ideal of `S`. The algebra `S`
is formally smooth over `R` for the `n`-adic topology if every `R`-algebra map
`g : S → D/J` killing some positive power of `n` lifts across each square-zero ideal
`J` of every commutative `R`-algebra `D` (Stacks, Tags 07EB and 07NI).
(blueprint: def-weil-pbc-formally-smooth-adic)

The power condition says that `g` is continuous from the `n`-adic topology to the
discrete topology (Tag 07E9). Any lift `f` kills `n ^ (2 * k)` if `g` kills `n ^ k`:
`f(n ^ k) ⊆ J`, so `f(n ^ (2 * k)) ⊆ J ^ 2 = 0` (Tag 07EC). Thus every lift is
continuous, as required by the topological definition in Tag 07EB. -/
