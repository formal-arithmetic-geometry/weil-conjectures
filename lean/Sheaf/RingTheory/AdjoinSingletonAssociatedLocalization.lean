/-- An associated-prime localization of the principal quotient of a fractional monogenic
algebra is isomorphic to a height-one localization of the normal base domain.
No Nagata hypothesis is needed for this comparison.

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 0334, Step 5, the paragraphs verifying (2) and (3)(a),
using Tags 00PQ, 031T and 00PD.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-monogenic-associated-localization).

Proof:
1. Put `S = R[x]`, contract `p` to `qS` in `S`, and contract again to `q` in `R`.
   The associated-contraction theorem identifies `q` as associated to `R/J`,
   where `J = R ∩ xR`. Its proof identifies `S/xS ≃ R/J` by adjoin induction
   and the reversed-polynomial integrality argument.
2. Tag 031T gives `q.height = 1`. Normality localizes, so `B = R_q` is a
   one-dimensional normal Noetherian local domain, hence a DVR by Tag 00PD.
3. Put `C = S_qS`. There is a local map `f : B → C` from the contracted primes.
   Embed `C` into `Frac(R)` by extending the inclusion `S ⊆ K` along the
   canonical identification `K ≃ Frac(R)`. Every denominator is nonzero,
   so this extension `g` is injective; its composite with `f` is the fraction
   field inclusion of `B`. A valuation ring is maximal among local subrings
   of its fraction field dominating it. Mathlib's
   `bijective_rangeRestrict_comp_of_valuationRing` therefore makes the map
   `B → range(g)` bijective. Injectivity of `g` gives `B ≃ C`.
4. Since `qS ≤ m` and `p` is its extension to `S_m`, iterated localization gives
   `A_p ≃ S_qS`. Compose with the isomorphism in step 3.
   If `x` becomes a unit in `S_m`, the principal quotient is zero and there are
   no associated primes, so the assertion is vacuous. -/
