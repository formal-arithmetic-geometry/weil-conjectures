/-- A finite-length module admits a finite strictly increasing filtration with simple quotients.

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tags 02LY, 00J1 and 00J3, part (2)
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-length-module-simple-filtration).

Proof: By `def-weil-pbc-module-length`, lengths of strict submodule chains are bounded by
`length R M`. Chains from zero to the whole module exist: use the one-term chain for the
zero module and the chain from zero to the whole module otherwise. Their lengths form a
nonempty bounded set of natural numbers, so choose a chain of largest length.
For each adjacent pair, its quotient is nonzero because the inclusion is strict. If the
quotient had a nonzero proper submodule, its inverse image under the quotient projection
would lie strictly between the adjacent terms. Inserting it would produce a longer chain,
contradicting maximality. Thus each quotient is simple by `def-weil-pbc-simple-module`.
