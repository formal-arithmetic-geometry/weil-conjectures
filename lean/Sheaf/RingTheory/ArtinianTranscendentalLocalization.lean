/-- Localizing D[t] at the inverse image of the target maximal ideal gives an Artinian
local essentially smooth factorization when the residue of x is transcendental.
Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps, proof of Tag 07FI, transcendental case,
with flatness justified by Algebra, Tag 00MP.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-artinian-transcendental-localization).

Proof: Let θ : D[t] → S evaluate t at x. The contracted prime P contains m_D[t] because
D → S is local. Modulo m_D[t], its map to the residue field K of S evaluates F[t] at the
residue α of x. Transcendence means that this evaluation is injective, so P = m_D[t].
Thus T = D[t]_P is Noetherian and local, and its maximal ideal equals m_D T and is
nilpotent, making T Artinian. The structure map D → T is local and essentially smooth,
since the polynomial algebra is smooth. Every polynomial outside P evaluates to a unit
of S, so the localization universal property extends θ to g' : T → S. This map is
local, factors D → S, and sends t/1 to x. Its flatness follows from the Noetherian fibre
criterion for D → T → S, M = S: S is flat over D, and T/m_D T = F(t) is a field, so the
fibre module is flat. The statement uses the canonical universe lift of T, preserving
all these properties.
This construction does not require θ to be injective. -/
