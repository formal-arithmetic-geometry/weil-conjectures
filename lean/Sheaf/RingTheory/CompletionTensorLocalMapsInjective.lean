/-- Local completion maps detect equality of completed tensors.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 07N9 (lemma-completion-finite-extension),
the quotient product decomposition and the final application of Tag 00MA.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-completion-tensor-local-maps-injective)

Proof:
1. Put A = R_p and B = A tensor_R S. B is finite over the Noetherian local ring A.
   Localization identifies the primes of B over its maximal ideal m with Q, and
   their local rings with S_q. Every B/m^n B for n > 0 is Artinian. Its canonical
   map to the product of S_q/m^n S_q is an isomorphism by Tags 00JA and 00CT.
2. These canonical maps commute with reduction. Thus the map from the m-adic
   completion of B into the product of the m-adic completions of S_q is injective:
   if every component is zero, each quotient coordinate is zero by the quotient
   product isomorphism, and the original compatible sequence is zero.
3. In S_q, the extended ideal m S_q has radical q S_q. Noetherianity gives a
   power of q S_q contained in m S_q; the converse inclusion is immediate.
   Tag 0394 identifies the two completions by the identity on S_q. Therefore
   replacing the factors by the maximal-ideal completions preserves injectivity.
4. Tag 00MA identifies C tensor_A B with the m-adic completion of B, and tensor
   cancellation identifies C tensor_A B with C tensor_R S. Under this canonical
   comparison the resulting map sends a tensor s to the tuple g_q(a) times s.
   The hypothesis on f determines g_q: choose a representative of each quotient
   coordinate of a and apply the displayed equation, then use extensionality of
   compatible sequences. S-linearity and tensor induction identify f with this
   comparison map. Composing the injections proves the claim. The zero algebra
   and empty Q are included: B/m^n B and its completion are then zero. -/
