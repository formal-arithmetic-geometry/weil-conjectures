/-- A Noetherian local algebra over a field, formally smooth for the maximal-ideal-adic
 topology, is a regular local ring. Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Tag 07EI
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-fs-adic-field-regular-local).

Proof (the six steps of the DAG node):
1. Reduce to the prime field using lem-weil-pbc-char-zero-field-extension-formally-smooth
   or lem-weil-pbc-field-char-p-nilpotent-lifting. Lift the field map first and then the
   algebra map by def-weil-pbc-formally-smooth-adic. If the original map kills m^q,
   the lift kills m^(2q), because the obstruction ideal is square-zero.
2. Pass to the maximal-ideal-adic completion using def-weil-pbc-adic-completion,
   lem-weil-pbc-adic-completion-noetherian and lem-weil-pbc-fs-adic-completion.
   Regularity descends by lem-weil-pbc-completion-regular-local.
3. Use lem-weil-pbc-cohen-coefficient-ring-exists to choose a coefficient field K.
   Choose a basis x_i of m/m^2, and form T = K[[X_1,...,X_n]] using
   def-weil-pbc-multivariate-power-series. The ring T is complete regular local of
   dimension n by lem-weil-pbc-power-series-field-cohen-regular-complete.
   Sending x_i to X_i identifies A/m^2 with T/n^2 as K-algebras.
4. Starting with A → T/n^2, lift successively through the square-zero kernels of
   T/n^(r+2) → T/n^(r+1) using def-weil-pbc-formally-smooth-adic.
   Each map kills a power of m. Completeness of T gives a local prime-field-algebra
   map f : A → T; these lifts need not be K-linear.
5. By lem-weil-pbc-nakayama-local-generators, the f(x_i) generate n.
   Approximate every t in T degree by degree with polynomials in the f(x_i), lifting
   coefficients to A. The corrections in m^r converge in complete A. Separatedness
   of T gives f(a) = t, so f is surjective.
6. Pullback of prime chains gives dim A ≥ dim T = n. Nakayama says that the x_i
   generate m, so lem-weil-pbc-noetherian-local-dimension-le-generators gives dim A ≤ n.
   Therefore dim A = n, proving regularity by def-weil-regular-scheme. Step 2 then
   gives regularity of the original A. -/
