/-- For a field `K` of positive characteristic `p`, the first homology of the naive
cotangent complex of the canonical presentation `𝔽_p[K] → K` is zero. The algebra
structure is the unique one, supplied by `ZMod.algebra K p`.

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Proposition Tag 0322, characteristic `p`, (1) ⇒ (5),
with `k = 𝔽_p`; used in More on Algebra, Proposition Tag 07E5, proof of (3) ⇔ (4).

Proof (the three steps of the node):
1. Every finitely generated field extension `E/𝔽_p` is separable. Apply
   `lem-weil-pbc-make-separable` to obtain an overfield `E''` separable over a finite
   purely inseparable extension `k'` of its prime field `P`. For `a ∈ k'`, some
   `a^(p^m) = c ∈ P`; Fermat gives `c^(p^m) = c`, hence `(a-c)^(p^m) = 0` and `a = c`.
   Thus `k' = P`. Every finitely generated subextension of `E` embeds in `E''`;
   transport its separating transcendence basis and separable algebraic extension
   back along this embedding. This gives separability in the sense of
   `def-weil-pbc-separable-field-extension`, using the purely inseparable,
   transcendence-basis and separable-algebraic-extension definition nodes.
2. For each finitely generated subfield `E` of `K`, use
   `lem-weil-pbc-separable-extension-fraction-field-of-smooth-algebra` to write
   `E = Frac B` for a smooth `𝔽_p`-algebra `B`. Smoothness gives zero first homology
   (`def-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map`); `lem-weil-pbc-h1-cotangent-localization` and
   `def-weil-pbc-module-localization` give the same for `Frac B`. The identification
   with `E` renames the variables of the canonical polynomial presentation
   (`def-weil-pbc-mv-polynomial-ring`), carries its kernel and its square onto those
   for `E`, and commutes with partial derivatives. It therefore identifies first homology.
3. A cycle represented by `g ∈ I = ker(𝔽_p[K] → K)` uses finitely many variables.
   Let `E` be the subfield they generate. Evaluation and partial derivatives restrict
   to `𝔽_p[E]`, so `g` represents a cycle for `E`. Step 2 gives `g ∈ I_E² ⊆ I²`.
   Every cycle is consequently zero. These are the finite-support reduction of
   Tag 07BQ and the localization argument of Tags 037X and 00S7.
