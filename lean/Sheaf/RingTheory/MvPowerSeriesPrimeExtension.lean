/-- Extending a prime ideal from a Noetherian coefficient ring to finitely many
power-series variables gives a prime ideal.

Source: Stacks Project, Tags 0312 and 0EY9, the coefficientwise quotient
argument in the associated-prime calculation.
(blueprint: lem-sbc-power-series-prime-extension)

Proof: Reduce coefficients modulo p. This is a surjective ring homomorphism
onto the power-series ring over A/p: choose a lift of each coefficient.
Its kernel consists of series all of whose coefficients lie in p.
Choose finitely many generators a_1,...,a_r of p, possible by Noetherianity.
For each coefficient choose its expression as a sum of a_i times scalars.
For every i the scalars form a power series f_i. The original series is
sum_i C(a_i)*f_i by coefficient extensionality. Thus the kernel is exactly
p.map C. The target is a domain, since A/p is a domain, so the kernel is prime.
For d=0 the coefficient reduction is the ordinary quotient map. The zero ring
has no prime ideal, and p=bot in a domain gives the domain power-series ring. -/
