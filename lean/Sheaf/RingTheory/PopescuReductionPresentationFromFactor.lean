/-- Lift a finite presentation of the standard smooth reduced factor.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 07CK, steps 3--4; Tag 00F4(4).

Regard `C` as an `A/IA`-algebra via `β`. Since `A/IA` is finite type over
`R/I` and `C` is finitely presented over `R/I`, `C` is finitely presented over
`A/IA`. Choose a finite presentation. Lift each relation coefficientwise to `A`
and each generator image under `δ` to `Λ`, using quotient surjectivity. The
factorization identity identifies evaluation modulo `IΛ` with evaluation in `C`
followed by `δ`, so each lifted relation evaluates into `IΛ`. The reduced quotient
is isomorphic to `C` over `R/I`, and standard smoothness transports along this
isomorphism. The finite-presentation hypothesis on `A` is essential (the old
statement failed for the augmentation from infinitely many polynomial variables).
