Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 032Z. If `R` is Noetherian local, `R_p` is a DVR,
and `p` is analytically unramified, then the completion localized at any associated
prime of its quotient by the extended ideal `p` is a DVR. The colon of the zero
submodule by `{z}` is exactly the annihilator of `z` (without taking a radical).

Proof, following the seven steps of the node:
1. The completion is Noetherian and flat over `R`
   (`lem-weil-pbc-adic-completion-noetherian`, `lem-weil-pbc-noetherian-completion-flat`).
   Its localization `C` at `q` is Noetherian local
   (`lem-weil-pbc-localization-noetherian`).
2. The quotient `B` of the completion by the extended `p` is the completion of `R/p`
   (`lem-weil-pbc-local-completion-quotient`), hence reduced by analytic unramifiedness.
3. Write `q = Ann(z)` for nonzero `z` in `B` and lift `z` to the completion.
   The lift is outside `q`, since otherwise `z^2 = 0` contradicts reducedness.
   For `a` in `q`, the product `az` belongs to the extended `p`; invert the lift
   in `C` to obtain `qC = pC`.
4. Multiplication by any `s` outside `p` is injective on `R/p`. Flatness preserves
   injectivity on `B`, so `s` cannot annihilate `z`; thus its image is outside `q`.
5. Choose `x` in `p` generating `pR_p` with nonzero image. Clear denominators on
   finitely many generators of `p` to find `s` outside `p` with `sp` contained in `xR`.
   Inverting `s` in `C` gives `qC = pC = xC`.
6. The finitely generated ideal `Ann_R(x)` vanishes at `p`, so some `t` outside `p`
   kills it. Flatness identifies `Ann(x)` in the completion with its extension.
   Inverting `t` shows that `x` is a nonzerodivisor in `C`.
7. Krull intersection (`lem-weil-pbc-krull-intersection-jacobson`) gives
   intersection of all `x^n C` equal to zero. Every nonzero element is a power of
   `x` times a unit; products of nonzero elements are nonzero. Hence `C` is a domain
   with nonzero principal maximal ideal, and therefore a DVR.
