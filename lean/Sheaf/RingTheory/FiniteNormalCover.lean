/-- Finite normal cover extracted from the local normal approximation hypotheses.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-normal-cover)
The closed non-normal loci attached to the finite intermediate algebras supplied at
maximal ideals have open complements covering `Spec A`.  Quasi-compactness of `Spec A`
therefore gives finitely many such algebras.  The resulting finite family is recorded here;
the topological and localization arguments are postponed to the theorem using this family. -/
