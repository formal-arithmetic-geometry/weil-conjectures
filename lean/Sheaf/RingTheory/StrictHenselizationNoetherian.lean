/-- For a local commutative ring, Noetherianity is equivalent to Noetherianity of its
strict henselization relative to a chosen separable closure of its residue field.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Lemma 15.46.3 (Tag 06LJ), conditions (1) and (3).

Proof: The map from the base ring to its strict henselization is faithfully flat, so
Noetherianity descends. Conversely, when the base is Noetherian, the completion of the
strict henselization is Noetherian and faithfully flat over it; faithfully flat descent
then gives Noetherianity of the strict henselization. These are the three proof steps
recorded in the DAG (lem-sc-strict-henselization-faithfully-flat,
lem-weil-pbc-faithfully-flat-descent-noetherian, and
lem-sc-strict-henselization-completion-noetherian).
