/-- A resolution at a minimal prime over the extended singular ideal descends from the
local problem when the target localization has dimension zero.

Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps, Lemma 07FA
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-delocalize-height-zero).

Proof:
1. Since `A` is finite type over the Noetherian ring `R`, it is Noetherian, and its
singular ideal has finitely many generators `a_i`.
2. Minimality puts their images in `q`. The only prime of the zero-dimensional local
ring `Λ_q` is its maximal ideal, so each image is nilpotent. Choose a common positive
exponent `N` and clear denominators to obtain `λ ∉ q` with `λ α(a_i)^N = 0` for all `i`.
This uses elementwise nilpotence, without assuming `Λ_q` is Artinian.
3. The weak delocalization lemma (lem-weil-pbc-popescu-delocalize-weak, Tag 07F9) gives
`A → C → Λ` with `C` finitely presented over `R` and an element `c ∈ H_{C/R}` mapping
outside `q`. Since `A` is Noetherian, present `C = A[x_k]/(f_j)` and lift `c` to `p_c`.
4. Set `B = A[x_k,y_i,z,t_ij]/(f_j - ∑ y_i t_ij, z y_i)`, a finitely presented
`R`-algebra. Map `x_k` through `C`, `y_i` to `α(a_i)^N`, `z` to `λ`, and `t_ij` to zero.
The relations vanish. If `c'` is the class of `p_c`, then `δ(zc') = λ γ(c) ∉ q` and
`δ(a_i y_i) = α(a_i)^(N+1)`.
5. By lem-weil-pbc-popescu-height-zero-auxiliary-algebra-localizations,
`B_z = C[t_ij,z]_z`. Polynomial extension and localization are smooth over `C`;
localizing also at `c'` gives a smooth algebra over the smooth `R`-algebra `C_c`.
Thus `B_(zc')` is smooth over `R`, and `zc' ∈ H_{B/R}`.
6. The same auxiliary lemma identifies `B_(y_l)` with a localized polynomial algebra
`A[x_k,y_i,t_ij (i ≠ l)]_(y_l)`. Localize further at `a_l`; polynomial extension,
localization and composition with the smooth map `R → A_(a_l)` show that
`B_(a_l y_l)` is smooth over `R`. Hence `a_l y_l ∈ H_{B/R}`.
7. The image of `zc'` shows `h_B ≰ q`. The images of `a_i y_i` put every `α(a_i)`
in `h_B`, hence `h_A ≤ h_B`. Together with finite presentation and the factorization,
these are exactly the conditions for a resolution. The construction also allows zero
generators or variables, interpreting empty products as one and empty sums as zero.

The tensor factors are reversed by the canonical commutativity isomorphism, so `A_p` is
`R_p ⊗[R] A` with the map of `lem-weil-pbc-popescu-delocalize-weak`; the local algebra
structure on `Λ_q` is the canonical one. `dim Λ_q = 0` is `ringKrullDim Λ_q = 0`. -/
