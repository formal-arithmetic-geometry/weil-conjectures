/-- Clear auxiliary relation certificates for equations generating the localized kernel.
Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps, proof of Tag 07F9,
`lemma-delocalize-weak`, the denominator-clearing paragraphs.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-weak-clear-relations)

Proof: The renamed gⱼ evaluates to zero, hence its coefficient extension belongs
to the kernel, which by hypothesis is the extension of (f). Polynomial scalar
extension is localization at the constants outside p. The localization criterion
for ideal membership gives a constant outside p whose product with the renamed
gⱼ is in (f). Choose one such constant for each j. For t = 0 there is nothing to
choose. -/
