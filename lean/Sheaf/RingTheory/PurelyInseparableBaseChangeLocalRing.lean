/-- Base change of a Noetherian local algebra along a finite purely inseparable extension is
finite free, flat, Noetherian and local, with the stated closed fibre and finite residue extension.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, proof of Proposition Tag 07E5, (3) => (1)
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-purely-inseparable-base-change-local-ring).

Proof (the six steps recorded in the node, expanding facts used without proof in Stacks):
1. Choose a k-basis of k' with d elements. Apply lem-weil-pbc-free-base-change-tower
   and swap tensor factors to obtain an A-basis of A' with d elements. This proves
   finite generation and freeness. Use lem-weil-pbc-projective-module-flat for flatness
   and lem-weil-pbc-finite-algebra-noetherian for Noetherianity. Since A is nonzero and
   d is positive, A' is nonzero.
2. Apply lem-weil-pbc-tensor-quotient-base-change at the maximal ideal m, swap factors
   and use lem-weil-pbc-tensor-cancel-base-change. The resulting closed-fibre isomorphism
   sends the class of a tensor x to the residue of a tensor x, so it commutes with the
   maps from A. Scalar extension of the k-basis gives a K-basis of K tensor k' with d
   elements (def-weil-vector-space-scalar-extension), hence its dimension is d.
3. Every element of K tensor k' is a unit or nilpotent. In characteristic zero pure
   inseparability makes k' = k. In characteristic p, write an element as a finite sum
   of pure tensors and choose a common p-power putting all its k'-coordinates in k.
   Frobenius (def-weil-ring-frobenius) turns that power into c tensor 1. If c vanishes
   the element is nilpotent; otherwise it is a unit.
4. The nilpotent elements form a proper ideal N. By step 3 every proper ideal lies in
   N, so N is maximal. Every prime contains N, and hence N is the unique prime.
5. Transport N through the closed-fibre isomorphism and take its inverse image m' in
   A'. The prime correspondence shows that m' is the only prime containing mA', and
   its quotient is a field. Every maximal ideal of A' contains mA', by
   lem-weil-pbc-finite-algebra-local-radical, hence equals m'. Thus A' is local.
6. The residue field A'/m' is a quotient of the d-dimensional closed fibre, so its
   canonical K-vector space is finite dimensional. The map K to this residue field is
   injective because both are fields. This gives the finite field extension. -/
