/-- The closed fibre of a polynomial local map is a polynomial local ring over the
residue field, with the natural formula for every polynomial.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Remark 0H9M and Tag 00SV, first proof paragraph.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-polynomial-local-closed-fiber-equiv).

Proof: Set `P = R[x]` and `p = Q ∩ R`. By the fibre-prime correspondence there is a prime
`T` of `p.Fiber P` whose contraction along `j : P → p.Fiber P` is `Q`.
The polynomial scalar-extension equivalence identifies `p.Fiber P` with `κ(p)[x]`
and sends `j(a) = 1 ⊗ a` to `map (R → κ(p)) a`. Transport `T` through this equivalence
to the prime `Qk`. Its contraction to `P` is therefore `Q`.
The natural fibre-local-ring quotient equivalence (0H9M) identifies
`P_Q / p P_Q` with `(p.Fiber P)_T`, sending `[a/1]` to `j(a)/1`.
The maximal ideal of `R_p` is `p R_p`. Its image under the local map `φ` generates
exactly `p P_Q`: use the natural formula for `φ` on `r/1` and note that all denominators
outside `p` become units. Thus its image ideal `I` equals `p P_Q`.
Compose the quotient equivalence with the localization of the scalar-extension
ring equivalence to obtain `e : P_Q/I ≃ κ(p)[x]_{Qk}`. Both equivalences have their
specified natural fraction formula, so their composite sends `[a/1]` to the displayed
coefficientwise image of `a` divided by `1`. The argument includes no variables and
arbitrary coefficient rings; a prime `Q` already ensures that these local rings exist
and are nonzero. No complete-intersection or Noetherian hypothesis is used.
