/-- The generic fibre of a characteristic-zero DVR completion is geometrically regular.

Proof: Choose a uniformizer π of A. Its image generates the maximal ideal of the
completion by the local-completion theorem. The completion is a DVR by Tag 0AP1, so
this image is nonzero and irreducible. Every nonzero element of the completion is a
unit times a power of this image. Base-changing to the fraction field inverts π and
therefore all nonzero elements of the completion; the generic fibre is its fraction
field. The residue field at the zero prime is the fraction field of A, hence has
characteristic zero. Every purely inseparable extension of a characteristic-zero
field is trivial. Tensoring the generic fibre with such an extension therefore gives
a field again. Fields are Noetherian and regular, proving both conjuncts.
