/-- If `A` is a G-ring, then the ring in a henselization of the pair `(A, I)` is a
G-ring. Here a henselization is represented by its colimit cocone, together with
the colimit, henselian-pair, and quotient-isomorphism properties of
`pair_henselization`.

Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Lemma Tag 0AH3 (the assertion that the
henselization of a pair with G-ring underlying ring is a G-ring); the displayed
hypotheses spell out the henselization supplied by Tag 0A02
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-henselization-pair-g-ring).

Proof (the five steps of the node):
1. The G-ring hypothesis includes Noetherianity. Apply
   lem-weil-pbc-henselization-noetherian-completion (Tag 0AGV): the henselization
   is Noetherian, the structure map is flat, and the ideal-adic completions agree.
2. Fix a maximal ideal of the henselization and take its inverse image in `A`.
   Henselianness puts the extended ideal inside this maximal ideal; the quotient
   isomorphism identifies the corresponding residue fields and extended maximal
   ideals. Localize the flat structure map and apply
   lem-weil-pbc-flat-local-completion-iso (Tag 0AGX) to identify the maximal-adic
   completions of these two local rings. Use lem-weil-pbc-pair-henselization for
   the quotient property.
3. For a prime of the base local ring and a prime above it, apply
   lem-weil-pbc-henselization-finite-separable-fibres (Tag 0AH1) to the Noetherian
   filtered colimit of etale algebras from lem-weil-pbc-pair-henselization.
   Its fibre is a finite product of residue fields, each separable algebraic
   over the base residue field; localizing retains the relevant factors.
4. The completion isomorphism and finite product decomposition identify the
   chosen completed fibre as a direct factor of the base completed fibre.
   By def-weil-pbc-g-ring the latter is geometrically regular over the base
   residue field, hence so is its direct factor. Apply
   lem-weil-pbc-geometric-regularity-separable-extension (Algebra Tag 07QH) to
   transfer this regularity to the chosen separable algebraic residue field.
5. All maximal local completion maps thus have geometrically regular fibres.
   Noetherianity from step 1 and lem-weil-pbc-g-ring-maximal-ideal-criterion
   (Tag 07PT) imply that the henselization is a G-ring.
