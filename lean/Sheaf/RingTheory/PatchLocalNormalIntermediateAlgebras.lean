/-- Patch finite intermediate algebras normal above individual maximal ideals.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 0333, first and third paragraphs of the reverse
implication, stopping before the identification with the integral closure.

Proof: Fix the nonzero f. The principal localization A_f is an integrally closed
domain: its prime localizations are normal, so use the local criterion for normality.
For any finite intermediate algebra C in the integral closure, C_f = A_f, since
C_f is integral over the integrally closed A_f inside their common fraction field K.
Such a C is Noetherian and has an open normal locus by Tag 0332. The image Z_C of
its closed non-normal locus in Spec A is closed, since C is integral over A.
For every maximal m choose a C normal at all primes over m, using hLocal. Thus
m avoids Z_C. Every prime p lies in a maximal m; if p belonged to this closed Z_C,
its specialization m would too. Hence the complements of the Z_C cover Spec A.
Quasi-compactness supplies finitely many C_i whose complements still cover.
Let B be their supremum as A-subalgebras of K. Finite suprema of finite algebras
are finite, and B remains contained in the integral closure.
For any prime q of B, its contraction p to A avoids some Z_C_i. The contraction
q_i to C_i therefore has normal localization (C_i)_q_i. Localizing B at
C_i \ q_i gives an integral subring of K over this normal domain, with the same
fraction field, so it equals (C_i)_q_i. The ring B_q is a further localization
of that ring and is integrally closed. This gives a finite B normal at all primes;
the final identification B = integralClosure A K is deliberately not part of this lemma. -/
