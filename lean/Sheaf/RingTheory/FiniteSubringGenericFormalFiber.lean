/-- Geometric regularity of the generic formal fibre ascends from a finite Noetherian
subring of a domain, with any chosen fraction field for the resulting fibre.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Proposition 07PS, second paragraph,
and Lemma 07PP(1).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-subring-generic-formal-fibre).

Proof: The subring inclusion is injective, so the zero prime of A contracts to the zero
prime of A0. Module finiteness implies finite type. For P0 = P intersect A0, its fibre
A tensor_A0 kappa(P0) is a finite-dimensional algebra over kappa(P0). Every prime quotient
is a finite-dimensional domain over a field and hence a field: multiplication by a
nonzero element is injective and therefore surjective. Its primes are maximal. The Chinese
remainder theorem bounds the number of distinct maximal ideals by the vector-space
dimension. Thus the spectrum is finite and discrete, and the inclusion is quasi-finite
at P. Apply 07PP(1) to the primes 0 contained in P and their contractions. This gives
geometric regularity of kappa_A(0) tensor_A completion(A_P). The universal property of
fraction fields gives an A-algebra isomorphism kappa_A(0) to K, since both localize A
at its nonzero elements. It induces the corresponding isomorphism of generic fibres.
For any finite purely inseparable extension L/K, regard L as an extension of kappa_A(0)
through this field isomorphism. Finiteness and pure inseparability are preserved, and
tensor cancellation identifies its base change of the old fibre with
L tensor_K (K tensor_A completion(A_P)). The old geometric regularity makes this ring
regular; Noetherianity transports through the fibre isomorphism. This proves the claim,
including the possible zero fibre. -/
