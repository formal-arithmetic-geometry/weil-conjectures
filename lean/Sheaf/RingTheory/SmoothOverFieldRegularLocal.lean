/-- If `A` is a smooth algebra over a field, every localization at a prime ideal
is a regular local ring (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-smooth-over-field-regular-local).

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 00TT, final assertion.
Proof:
1. Smoothness gives finite type, so `A` is Noetherian. Localization makes `A_q`
   Noetherian and local.
2. Smoothness gives formal smoothness over `k`, which is preserved by localization.
   Its square-zero lifting property applies to every algebra map, hence in particular
   to the maps killing a power of the maximal ideal. Thus `A_q` is formally smooth
   for the maximal-ideal-adic topology.
3. Apply Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Lemma Tag 07EI, as stated in
   `Algebra.isRegularLocalRing_of_formallySmoothAdic`. This is a generic local-algebra
   regularity criterion; no dimension or residue-field comparison is necessary.
