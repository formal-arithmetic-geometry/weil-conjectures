/-- After a scalar extension killing pi, the prepared chart is a polynomial algebra
on E_k over the scalar extension of the smooth reduced coefficient chart.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 07CP, polynomial chart calculation modulo pi and its
residue-field base change.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-zero-base-chart-polynomial).

Proof: Since pi maps to zero in B, tensoring the explicit presentation of D with B
sets every f_l to zero and removes each pi g_kl term. Localizing at the image of s
inverts the same a_k: hc identifies their images modulo pi, and scalar extension
kills the difference, which belongs to pi D. Eliminate z_l outside E_k using the
k-th relations. Comparing the two conormal expressions for a_k a_k' f_l makes the
remaining coefficient b_j zero in the reduced coefficient chart, by its specified
basis. Clear a power of a_k before scalar extension, so this coefficient remains
zero after tensoring with B. All other chart relations are redundant. The coefficient
quotient is B tensor over R/pi squared with the reduced quotient localized at a_k;
localization commutes with scalar extension. Send the free z_j to themselves and
eliminated z_l to a_k inverse times their coefficient sum. These substitutions are
inverse on x_i and every z_l. ULift is removed by its algebra equivalence. This proves
the displayed B-algebra isomorphism without selecting a lifting algebra by existence. -/
