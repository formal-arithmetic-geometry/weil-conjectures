/-- A Noetherian ring is a G-ring iff all maximal local completion maps are regular.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Lemma 07PT
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-g-ring-maximal-ideal-criterion).

Proof plan, following the nine steps of the node:
1. A maximal ideal is prime, so the forward direction is immediate from
   def-weil-pbc-g-ring.
2. Conversely, for a prime p choose a maximal ideal m containing p. Put A = R_m and
   c : A → completion(A). Localization-at-prime and lem-weil-pbc-flat-local-ring-maps
   give Noetherian local rings A and R_p.
3. The lemmas lem-weil-pbc-adic-completion-noetherian,
   lem-weil-pbc-local-completion-local-ring and lem-weil-pbc-adic-completion-mod-ideal
   make completion(A) Noetherian complete local. By
   lem-weil-pbc-local-completion-faithfully-flat, choose a prime p' over pA.
4. Put B = completion(A)_(p'). By lem-weil-pbc-complete-local-g-ring applied to
   completion(A), its local completion map c_B : B → completion(B) is regular.
5. By lem-weil-pbc-flat-local-ring-maps, c induces a flat local map phi : R_p → B.
   Localization-at-prime identifies A_(pA) with R_p, and phi composed with A → R_p
   equals c followed by the localization lambda : completion(A) → B.
6. The map c is regular by hypothesis, lambda by lem-weil-pbc-localization-regular,
   and c_B by step 4. The targets B and completion(B) are Noetherian by step 5 and
   lem-weil-pbc-adic-completion-noetherian; their fibres are quotients of localizations,
   hence Noetherian. Twice apply lem-weil-pbc-regular-composition to obtain regularity
   of c_B composed with lambda composed with c.
7. By lem-weil-pbc-regular-through-localization, the resulting map
   c_B composed with phi : R_p → completion(B) is regular.
8. Complete phi to phi_hat : completion(R_p) → completion(B). This is flat by
   lem-weil-pbc-flat-completion, and local by lem-weil-pbc-local-completion-local-ring
   and compatibility with the completion maps. Thus
   lem-weil-pbc-flat-local-hom-faithfully-flat makes its map on spectra surjective.
9. Apply lem-weil-pbc-regular-permanence to R_p → completion(R_p) → completion(B):
   the composite is regular by step 7 and the second map is flat and surjective on
   spectra by step 8. The first map is therefore regular. Since p was arbitrary,
   def-weil-pbc-g-ring gives IsGRing R. -/
