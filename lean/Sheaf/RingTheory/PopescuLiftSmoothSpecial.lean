/-- The two special-fibre smoothness conclusions for the explicit prepared quotient.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 07CP, construction of D_k and proof of properties (c), (d).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-lift-smooth-special).

Proof: Put Q = R[x,z], u_j = f_j - π z_j, and
p_{kl} = a_k z_l - Σ_{j ∈ E_k} h_{klj} z_j - π g_{kl}.
The cleared relations imply π p_{kl} = -a_k u_l + Σ_{j ∈ E_k} h_{klj} u_j.
For a fixed chart k form D_k using
f_j-πz_j only for j in E_k and p_{kl} only for l outside E_k. Normalization makes
p_{kl}=0 for l in E_k, so there are exactly m relations in n+m variables. Modulo π
and after inverting a_k, solve for the z_l outside E_k. The resulting ring is
(Cbar/πCbar)_{a_k}[z_j : j in E_k], with the generator map in the statement.
The smooth chart and the complementary differential basis give, after base change,
a smooth fibre of dimension (n-|E_k|)+|E_k|=n. Equation count gives flatness at
primes containing π and avoiding a_k; the flat smooth fibre criterion gives
smoothness of R → D_k there. The key equality makes all f_l-πz_l vanish in
(D_k)_{a_k}. For another chart k', compute the relation among the conormal basis
with coefficients a_{k'}h_{klj}-Σh_{k'lj'}h_{kj'j}. Basis independence makes these
coefficients zero in the localized reduced quotient. Clear denominators, using
the cleared f relations, to put a power of a_k times each coefficient in I_E+π²P.
Expanding the p equations now puts p_{k'l} in π(D_k)_{a_k}. It is also killed by π
by the key equality. The smooth local ring is flat over R, so flat base change of
annihilators carries Ann_R(π)=Ann_R(π²) to that local ring, forcing p_{k'l}=0.
Thus every generator of the kernel D_k → D vanishes locally. This finite kernel
is killed on a principal neighbourhood outside the prime, where the quotient
map is an isomorphism. Transfer the two smoothness properties of D_k to D by
principal localization. Finally the cover property selects such a chart for
every prime in the special fibre lying over the smooth locus of Cbar. The generator
identity and cmod compatibility identify the special-fibre algebra structures.
ULift is an algebra equivalence and preserves all the constructions and properties.
