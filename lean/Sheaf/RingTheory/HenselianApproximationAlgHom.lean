/-- Approximate a map from a finitely presented algebra into the completion by an
algebra map to the original henselian G-ring, with the same reduction modulo I.
Source: Stacks Project, proof of Lemma 0GS2, lines 1830–1837
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-henselian-approximation-alg-hom).

Proof: choose a finite presentation of R by finitely many variables and relations.
The images of its generators under c solve these relations in the I-adic completion.
Apply henselian_pair_approximation with N = 1. The resulting elements of A solve the
relations, so evaluation factors through the presentation to an A-algebra map σ : R → A.
Each generator differs from its completed image by an element of IB. The kernel of the
completion projection to A/I is IB; that projection composed with A → B is the quotient
map. Consequently the two maps to A/I agree on all generators and on A, and hence on R.
This argument also covers zero variables or relations; for R = A it gives the identity.
