/-- The polynomial ring in one variable over a Noetherian N-2 domain is N-2.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma 10.161.13 (Tag 032O), second assertion
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-polynomial-ring-n2).

Proof (the eight steps of the node).
1. Let `K` be the fraction field of `R` and `R'` its normalization in `K`.
   The N-2 hypothesis makes `R'` finite over `R`. It is a Noetherian normal domain by
   `lem-weil-pbc-integral-closure-finite-extension-normal` and
   `lem-weil-pbc-finite-algebra-noetherian`. Transitivity of integrality
   (`lem-weil-pbc-integral-transitive`) identifies the integral closures of `R` and `R'`
   in every finite extension of `K`, so `R'` is N-2. Coefficientwise generators make
   `R'[X]` finite over `R[X]`; their fraction fields agree. The same transitivity and
   `lem-weil-pbc-finite-module-over-finite-algebra` reduce the assertion to `R'`.
   Here finiteness implies integrality by `lem-weil-pbc-finite-algebra-is-integral`.
2. We may thus assume `R` normal. Its polynomial ring is a Noetherian normal domain by
   `lem-weil-pbc-finite-type-algebra-noetherian`, `lem-weil-pbc-polynomial-ring-domain`,
   and `lem-weil-pbc-polynomial-ring-normal-domain`. Clearing coefficient denominators
   identifies its fraction field with `K(x)` (`def-weil-rational-function-field`).
3. In characteristic zero every finite extension of `K(x)` is separable by
   `lem-weil-pbc-char-zero-field-extension-separable`; its transcendence basis is empty.
   Apply `lem-weil-pbc-noetherian-normal-separable-integral-closure-finite`.
4. In characteristic `p > 0`, `lem-weil-pbc-n2-char-p-purely-inseparable-criterion`
   reduces the assertion to finite purely inseparable extensions `L/K(x)`.
5. Choose a basis of `L/K(x)` and a common power `q = p^e` carrying its elements into
   `K(x)`. In an algebraic closure, adjoin to `K` the `q`-th roots of the coefficients
   of their rational-function numerators and denominators, obtaining `L'`. The monomials
   in these roots with exponents below `q` span a finite-dimensional domain, hence a
   field. This is a finite purely inseparable extension of `K`. Choose `t` with `t^q = x`.
   Injectivity of the iterated Frobenius (`def-weil-ring-frobenius`) shows that the
   basis elements lie in `L'(t)`. The tower law
   (`lem-weil-pbc-field-degree-multiplicativity`) makes `L'(t)/K(x)` finite.
6. The closure in `L` is the intersection with `L` of the closure `C` in `L'(t)`.
   By `lem-weil-pbc-noetherian-submodule-finite`, it suffices to show `C` finite.
7. Let `A` be the integral closure of `R` in `L'`. The element `t` is transcendental over
   `L'`, since otherwise `x = t^q` would be algebraic over `K`. The ring `A` is normal
   with fraction field `L'` by `lem-weil-pbc-integral-closure-finite-extension-normal`.
   Thus `A[t]` is normal with fraction field `L'(t)` by
   `lem-weil-pbc-polynomial-ring-normal-domain`. Its generators are integral over `R[x]`,
   so `A[t]` lies in `C`; normality gives the reverse inclusion.
8. The N-2 hypothesis makes `A` finite over `R`. If `a_j` generate `A`, the elements
   `a_j t^r` for `0 ≤ r < q` generate `A[t]` over `R[x]`, by division of exponents by
   `q` and `t^q = x`. Steps 6 and 4 finish positive characteristic, and steps 1 and 3
   finish the assertion. All closures and finiteness conditions use
   `def-weil-pbc-integral-closure` and `def-weil-finitely-generated-module`. -/
