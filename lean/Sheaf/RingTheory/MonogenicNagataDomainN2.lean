/-- An injective monogenic extension of Nagata domains is N-2.

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Proposition Tag 0334, claim (*) and Steps 3--4
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-monogenic-nagata-domain-n2).

Proof: Write `K = Frac(A)` and `L = Frac(B)` and view `K` inside `L` using
injectivity. If `x` is transcendental over `K`, evaluation identifies `B` with
`A[X]`. The zero prime in the Nagata definition makes `A` N-2, and Tag 032O makes
`A[X]` N-2. Otherwise `L = K(x)` is finite over `K`. For an arbitrary finite field
extension `M/L`, the tower law makes `M/K` finite. The integral closure `A'` of `A`
in `M` is finite over `A` by N-2, normal with fraction field `M`, and Nagata by
Tag 032T. Put `T = A'[x]` inside `M`. Module generators of `A'` over `A` generate
`T` over `B`, so `T/B` is finite. Its fraction field is `M` since it contains `A'`.
Integrality transitivity identifies the integral closure of `B` in `M` with the
integral closure of `T` in `M`. Claim (***) of Tag 0334, namely normalization
finiteness for a monogenic subalgebra of the fraction field of a normal Nagata
domain, makes this closure finite over `T`. Finiteness transitivity makes it finite
over `B`. This proves N-2 for every finite extension `M/L`.

The cases `x = 0` and `x` in the image of `A` fall in the algebraic case, where
`B` equals the image of `A`; no nonzero or transcendence hypothesis is required. -/
