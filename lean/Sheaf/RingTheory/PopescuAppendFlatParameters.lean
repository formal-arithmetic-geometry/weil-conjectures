/-- Appending selected maximal-ideal generators to fixed differential coordinates gives
flat polynomial coordinates. No admissible subalgebra or enlargement is constructed here.

through property (1); More on Algebra, Tag 07E6.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-append-flat-parameters).

Proof: Localize the geometrically regular algebra at `q`; geometric regularity persists,
because purely inseparable scalar extension commutes with localization and localization
preserves regular rings. Identify `F` with its image under `ι`, a finitely generated
intermediate field of the residue field (essential finite type for field extensions is
finite generation). Apply 07E6 to the polynomial map on `xs` and the given differential
basis. This gives a flat map from the first polynomial localization and a regular local
closed fibre `S`. The images of `ys` generate its maximal ideal. Extract a basis from their
images in the cotangent space, and retain the corresponding indices `s`. Nakayama makes
these selected elements generators of the maximal ideal of `S`; their number is its
embedding dimension, hence its dimension. They are therefore a regular system of parameters
and a regular sequence by 00NQ. Append precisely these `ys (s i)` to `xs`, using `Fin.addCases`.
The contracted prime contains the added variables. Its extended ideal is contained in
`q` and contains the first-coordinate ideal and the selected parameters, whose sum is `q`
after localization, proving the ideal equality. The fibre of the extended polynomial
localization over the first one is the polynomial ring over the first residue field
localized at the origin: its prime contains all new variables, which already generate a
maximal ideal. By 00OP it is regular local, with the new variables as parameters. Their
images in `S` are a regular sequence, so 07DY gives flatness of the closed-fibre map.
Finally 00MP, applied to the first polynomial localization, the extended one, and
`Localization.AtPrime q` as a module over itself, lifts this fibre flatness and the initial
flatness to flatness of the extended map. Its restriction to the polynomial ring is the
explicit `aeval` map by the localization universal property.

If `t = 0`, 07E6 still applies to the empty basis. If the closed fibre is a field, choose
`e = 0`. If `r = 0`, the localized maximal ideal is zero, so this latter case applies.
No injectivity of the selected indexing function is required by the conclusion. -/
