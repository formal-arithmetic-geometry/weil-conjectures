/-- Completion of a finite algebra decomposes over the primes above a prime of the base.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma 10.97.8 (Tag 07N9)
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-completion-finite-extension).

The factors are indexed by all primes lying over `p`, with finiteness a conclusion.
The maps `g q` are specified modulo every power of the maximal ideals, so they are
exactly the completion maps induced by `Localization.localRingHom`. The equation on
`a ⊗ₜ 1` expresses compatibility with the completed-base algebra structures.

Proof:
1. Localize at `p`: put `A = R_p`, `B = A ⊗ S`. Localization-base-change and
   localization-prime-residue-field-iso identify the primes over the maximal ideal of
   `A` with the primes over `p`, and their localizations with `S_q`. The localization
   is Noetherian by localization-noetherian; finite-type-algebra-noetherian applies to `S`.
2. For each positive `n`, finite-over-zero-dim-local-discrete-spectrum shows that
   `B / p^n B` has exactly these finitely many maximal ideals and nil Jacobson radical.
   Product-of-localizations-at-maximal decomposes this quotient, including the zero ring
   when there are no primes over `p`.
3. Localization-at-prime-of-quotient identifies each factor with `S_q / p^n S_q`.
   These identifications commute with reduction. Taking compatible sequences componentwise
   gives the product decomposition of the `p B`-adic completion of `B`.
4. Finite-after-completion identifies the `p`-adic and maximal-ideal-adic completions of
   each `S_q`, compatibly with both `S` and the completion of `A`.
5. Completion-finite-module-tensor gives `A^ ⊗_A B ≃ B^` and
   tensor-cancel-base-change identifies the source with `A^ ⊗_R S`.
6. Compose these isomorphisms. They are `S`-linear and compatible with the completed
   base; both sides are isomorphic to `B^`. An empty product is the zero ring. -/
