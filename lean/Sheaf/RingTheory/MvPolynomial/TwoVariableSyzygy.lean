/-- Every relation between the two variables of `k[x₀, x₁]` is a multiple of `(x₁, -x₀)`.
Source: the Weil conjectures blueprint, `lem-sc-p1-graded-resolution`, Koszul middle exactness
(blueprint: lem-sc-p1-linear-syzygy).

Proof: Regard the ring as `k[x₁][x₀]` and write `b = b₀ + x₀ b₁`, with `b₀` in `k[x₁]`
and `b₁` in the whole ring `k[x₁][x₀]`.
The constant coefficient in `x₀` of the relation is `b₀ x₁ = 0`. Since `k[x₁]` is a domain
and `x₁` is nonzero, `b₀ = 0`, so `b = x₀ b₁`. Substitution gives
`x₀ (a + b₁ x₁) = 0`. The two-variable polynomial ring is also a domain and `x₀` is nonzero,
so `a = -b₁ x₁`. Both domain assertions are supplied by
`lem-weil-pbc-polynomial-ring-domain`. Set `c = -b₁` to obtain the two required equalities. -/
