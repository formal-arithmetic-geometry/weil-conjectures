# Power series over a Noetherian normal domain

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma 10.37.9 (Tag 0BI0)
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-power-series-normal-domain).

The one-variable ring is Mathlib's `PowerSeries R`, the one-variable case of the
recorded power series notion.
Normality for a domain is `IsIntegrallyClosed`, integrality in its fraction field.

/-- A one-variable power series ring over a Noetherian normal domain is a Noetherian normal
 domain. Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma 10.37.9 (Tag 0BI0)
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-power-series-normal-domain).

Proof following Stacks 0BI0, with the negative-order argument replaced by Mathlib's
normality of power series over a field:

1. Mathlib supplies Noetherianity and the domain property.
2. Put `K = Frac(R)` and embed `Frac(R[[x]])` into `K((x))` by the fraction-field lift of
coefficientwise inclusion followed by `HahnSeries.ofPowerSeries`.
3. An integral element maps to an element integral over `K[[x]]`. Power series over a field
are a unique factorization domain, hence integrally closed, and `K((x))` is their fraction
field. Thus the Laurent image is a power series `f` over `K`.
4. Transport the almost-integrality witness of the original fraction to `f`. If coefficients
below `n` vanish, factor `f = X^n * g`. For a nonzero witness `h`, put `m = order(h)` and
factor `h = X^m * h.divXPowOrder`. The coefficient of `h*f^e` at `m+n*e` is
`coeff m h * (coeff n f)^e`. It belongs to `R` for every `e`, so `coeff n f` is almost
integral over `R`. Noetherianity and normality put this coefficient in `R`.
5. Induct on `n`, subtracting the finite polynomial of already descended coefficients.
Almost integral elements form a subalgebra, so the difference remains almost integral.
Apply step 4 to obtain its coefficient at `n`, which equals that of `f`.
6. Choose coefficient preimages from these proved membership statements and form the power
series over `R` using `PowerSeries.mk`. Its Laurent image equals the image of the original
fraction. Injectivity of the fraction-field lift finishes the proof. -/
