/-- A detecting derivation can be chosen to kill a coefficient subring over which
`B` is finite type.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Lemma 07PH (`lemma-find-D`).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-coefficient-detecting-derivation)
Proof: replace the complete local base by its image, a complete Noetherian local
characteristic-p domain. Cohen structure makes it finite over a power series ring
R over a field k. Noether normalization gives a polynomial ring A over R and a
subring B' of B finite over A, with B'_g = B_g and equal fraction fields M.
The given detecting derivation implies that f is not a pth power: the Leibniz
formula D(x^p) = p*x^(p-1)*D(x) is zero in characteristic p. Choose a p-basis
of k. The coefficient subfields of 07P5 give subrings A_J with A finite over A_J
and fraction subfields K_J whose intersection is K^p. By 07P4 in the finite
extension M/K, the intersection of M^p K_J is M^p. Since f is not a pth
power, it lies outside M^p K_J for some J. The kernel criterion for the
universal differential over K_J is M^p K_J, so this relative differential
of f is nonzero.
A linear functional nonzero on this relative differential, composed with the
universal derivation, gives δ on M killing A_J and nonzero on f. Regard A_J as a
subring of B. Since A is finite over A_J, and B is finite type over R and hence
over A (the original finite algebra generators still generate over the
larger subring A), transitivity makes B finite type over A_J. This gives the stated
coefficient subring and derivation. No denominator clearing is used here. -/
