/-- A resolution modulo all the eighth powers lifts to the original local problem.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-lift-solution).

The reduced algebra structures are Mathlib's `Ideal.Quotient.algebraQuotientMapQuotient`
instances; the reduced map and prime are specified by their compatibility with the quotient
maps, which determines them uniquely; the finite-presentation witness (true by base change)
is included only to type the recorded definition of `CanBePopescuResolved`.
The annihilator equalities are expressed pointwise as equivalences of vanishing products.

Proof (the seven steps of the node):
1. Induct on `r`, with the one-element case as base.
2. Reduction by an ideal in the inverse image of `q` remains Situation 07F7: the base is
Noetherian, the algebra finitely presented by base change, and the quotient prime is prime
(lem-weil-pbc-finite-type-algebra-noetherian, lem-weil-pbc-tensor-quotient-base-change,
lem-weil-pbc-finite-presentation-base-change-composition). Iterated reductions agree.
3. Singular ideals map into singular ideals under base change: smooth principal
localizations remain smooth after base change, and take radicals
(def-weil-pbc-singular-ideal, lem-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map-base-change-composition,
lem-weil-pbc-localization-base-change, lem-weil-pbc-tensor-quotient-base-change).
4. For one element, apply lem-weil-pbc-popescu-desingularize-lifting-apply (07F0) to a
resolution of the reduction. Its hypotheses are precisely the two annihilator equalities
and strict standardness. Obtain a finitely presented factorization through `B`, smooth
away from `π`, and the stated containment of the reduced singular ideal.
5. The image of `π` belongs to the singular ideal of `B`, since its localization is smooth
(lem-weil-pbc-polynomial-ring-smooth, lem-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map-principal-localization,
lem-weil-pbc-localization-base-change, lem-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map-base-change-composition).
Thus `π^8 Λ` lies in `h_B`, and the radical ideal of the reduced resolution lies in its image.
6. Lift an element of that ideal outside the quotient prime to show `h_B` is not contained
in `q`. Step 3 and the reduced resolution imply `h_A ≤ h_B`, giving a resolution
(def-weil-pbc-popescu-resolution).
7. For more than one element, first reduce by the first eighth power. The remaining
annihilator hypotheses identify with the original ones by iterated quotients; strict
standardness survives by lem-weil-pbc-strictly-standard-base-change (07CC). Apply induction
to the remaining elements, then the one-element case to lift back to `R`.
