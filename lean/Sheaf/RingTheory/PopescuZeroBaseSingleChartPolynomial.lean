/-- The single-chart quotient becomes a polynomial algebra when pi is killed.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 07CP, the displayed three-line calculation for D_k modulo pi.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-zero-base-single-chart-polynomial).

Proof: Tensor the quotient by all u_l=f_l-pi*z_l and the single chart's
p_kl with B, then invert the image of a_k. Since pi is zero in B, the u_l
become all f_l=0. Reducing coefficients modulo pi squared changes nothing.
Thus the coefficient quotient is the scalar extension of reducedQuotient.
Localization commutes with scalar extension, identifying the coefficient ring
with B tensor over R/(pi squared) with reducedQuotient[1/reducedElement(k)].
The chart relations become a_k*z_l=sum h_klj*z_j. Normalization makes those
indexed by E_k zero. Since a_k is a unit, solve the remaining equations uniquely
for z_l outside E_k. Send each free variable to z_j and send each other z_l
back to a_k inverse times sum h_klj*z_j. These maps are inverse on the coefficient
ring and on every variable. Quotient and tensor-product universal properties
construct the maps, and ULift is removed by its algebra equivalence. This is a
calculation for a quotient with only one chart's equations: no other chart's
relations, conormal basis, smoothness or differential basis is used. -/
