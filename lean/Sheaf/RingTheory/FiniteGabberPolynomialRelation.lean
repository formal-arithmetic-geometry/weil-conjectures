/-- Gabber's relation vanishes after a faithfully flat base change, in the quotient
by the finite coefficient submodule.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Lemma Tag 0EM0, construction before descent.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-zariski-pair-finite-gabber-polynomial-upstairs-relation)

Proof: Apply Tag 07M4 to lift the idempotent (1,0) over an etale A-algebra A' preserving
A/I. Split the finite base change of B using this idempotent. The first factor has
surjective structure map modulo IA'. Its finite cokernel is equal to IA' times itself;
Nakayama (00DV) gives g in 1+IA' annihilating it. Localize A' at g to obtain C, so the
first factor is a quotient of C and C/IC is still A/I. Lift the image of b-1 in that
factor to a' in IC. In the second factor the image of b belongs to the extended ideal;
00H5 gives a monic annihilator G congruent to a power of X. Multiply G by X to ensure
its degree d is positive, including when that factor is zero. Then (X-1-a')G
annihilates both components. Its difference from (X-1)X^d has degree at most d and
coefficients in IC. Thus the image of (b-1)b^d belongs to the C-submodule generated
by the images of i b^j, i in I, j at most d. This is the image of the base change of
the range of the coefficient map displayed below. Right exactness of tensor product
therefore kills the displayed class in C tensor (B/N). Finally C is flat over A
(etale followed by localization), and every maximal ideal contains I and has nonzero
fibre since C/IC is A/I. The maximal-ideal criterion (00HP) makes C faithfully flat.
No descent to B is asserted here; that is proved in the importing module. -/
