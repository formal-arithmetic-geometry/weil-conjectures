/-- The localization smoothness argument from a radical-span relation.

This is the finite-cover reduction: a power of `f` lies in the span of smooth
principal-localization elements, so those elements generate the unit ideal after
localizing at `f`; smoothness is then local on that cover. The final span-locality
step is isolated in `smooth_of_localization_span_universes`.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-singular-ideal-localization-smooth-radical-span).
Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps, proof of Lemma 07EU, and Algebra,
Lemma 00TC. Map the span relation into `A_f`; its left side is a unit, hence the
images of the smooth elements span the unit ideal. For each smooth element `g`,
the iterated localizations `(A_g)_f` and `(A_f)_g` are localizations of `A` at
`f * g`, so the canonical algebra equivalence identifies them. The first is
smooth by composition with a principal localization. Transport smoothness to
the second and apply the span-locality criterion. This also covers `n = 0`,
nilpotent `f`, and the zero ring without any nontriviality assumption. -/

/-- If an element belongs to the singular ideal, its principal localization is smooth.
This follows by `Ideal.mem_radical_iff` and the radical-span reduction above.
