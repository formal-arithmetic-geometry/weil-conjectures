/-- Completion at a quasi-finite prime splits off via the natural projection.

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 07NC
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-completion-at-quasi-finite-prime).

The local map is `Localization.localRingHom` and the completions are taken at the
maximal ideals of the localizations, as in `AdicCompletion.completion_finite_extension`.
The map `ψ` is characterized on every quotient coordinate, so it is the map induced on
completions.
The formula for `φ` on pure tensors specifies the natural projection, including its
compatibility with both the `S`-action and the completed-base action. Transporting these
actions along `β` gives the corresponding actions on `B` and the product.

Proof (the eight steps of the node):
1. Choose a finite R-subalgebra S' and g outside q' = S' ∩ q with S'_g ≅ S_g, using
   lem-weil-pbc-quasi-finite-at-finite-subalgebra-away (00QB, pointwise via 00Q9).
2. Clearing powers of g proves S'_{q'} ≅ S_q; the isomorphism carries maximal-ideal
   powers onto one another, hence gives an isomorphism α of completions. The induced
   local and completed maps commute (def-weil-pbc-localization-at-prime,
   def-weil-pbc-module-localization-away, def-weil-pbc-adic-completion).
3. Apply lem-weil-pbc-completion-finite-extension (07N9) to T = Rph ⊗[R] S'. Select
   the idempotent e corresponding to the q' factor; Te maps isomorphically to its
   completed local ring (def-weil-finitely-generated-module).
4. For j = 1 ⊗ inclusion : T → U, check φ ∘ j = α ∘ φ' on pure tensors, using step 2.
5. Localization commutes with these tensor products, so j becomes an isomorphism after
   inverting g (lem-weil-pbc-localization-tensor-over-base,
   def-weil-pbc-module-localization-away).
6. The image of g in the first completed factor is a unit. Thus γe is a unit in Te,
   where γ = 1 ⊗ g. Its inverse v gives vγe = e; put f₀ = j(e) and w = j(v).
7. The restriction j : Te → Uf₀ is bijective: clear g-denominators using step 5, then
   multiply by powers of v or w using step 6 (def-weil-pbc-module-localization-away).
8. Put B = U(1-f₀) and β(u) = u(1-f₀). Step 4 shows φ vanishes on 1-f₀, and steps
   2, 3, 7 show its restriction to Uf₀ is an isomorphism. Compose the idempotent
   decomposition U ≅ Uf₀ × B with this isomorphism to obtain (φ, β). The pure-tensor
   formula gives the S- and Rph-algebra compatibilities, including the source's sanity
   check that the projection is the natural map. -/
