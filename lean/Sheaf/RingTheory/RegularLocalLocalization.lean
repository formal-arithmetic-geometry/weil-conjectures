/-- A prime localization of a regular local ring is regular local, and the ring is regular.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 0AFS and Definition Tag 00OD
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-regular-local-localization).

Proof:
1. `R` is Noetherian by regularity. Its localization at the complement of `p` is Noetherian
   by `lem-weil-pbc-localization-noetherian` and local by
   `def-weil-pbc-localization-at-prime`, with maximal ideal the extension of `p`.
2. By `lem-weil-pbc-regular-local-finite-gl-dim`, `R` has global dimension at most its
   Krull dimension, hence finite global dimension (`def-weil-pbc-finite-global-dimension`).
3. By `lem-weil-pbc-localization-finite-gl-dim`, this bound is preserved upon localization
   at the complement of `p`, so `Localization.AtPrime p` has finite global dimension.
4. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-finite-gl-dim-regular-local` to this Noetherian local ring to obtain
   the first assertion.
5. Repeat for every prime. Together with Noetherianity of `R`, this is `IsRegularRing R`
   by `def-weil-regular-scheme` (Stacks Definition Tag 00OD). At the maximal ideal,
   the localization is isomorphic to `R`, consistently with its original regularity. -/
