A flat local homomorphism of Noetherian local rings inducing an isomorphism on
residue fields induces an isomorphism on the corresponding adic completions.
Source: More on Algebra, Lemma Tag 0AGX (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-flat-local-completion-iso).
Proof:
1. The completions are local with the same residue fields, by
   `lem-weil-pbc-local-completion-local-ring`.
2. Since the extended maximal ideal equals that of B, their powers agree after
   extension. Thus B's completion is also its completion as an A-module.
3. The residue field has dimension one over A's residue field, so
   `lem-weil-pbc-finite-after-completion` makes B's completion finite over A's.
4. Flatness gives vanishing of Tor with the residue field;
   `lem-weil-pbc-flat-module-completion-flat` makes the completed module flat.
5. `lem-weil-pbc-finite-flat-local-free` makes this finite flat module free.
6. By `lem-weil-pbc-adic-completion-mod-ideal` and the local structure from step 1,
   reduction modulo the maximal ideal identifies its fibre with the residue field.
   The residue-field isomorphism therefore forces the free rank to be one.
7. Write 1 = u e in a one-element basis. If u were in the maximal ideal, 1 would
   reduce to zero in the residue field. Thus u is a unit; 1 is itself a basis,
   and the induced ring homomorphism is bijective.
