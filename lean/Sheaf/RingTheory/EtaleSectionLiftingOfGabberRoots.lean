/-- Gabber's root condition for an ideal in the Jacobson radical implies that every
section of an étale algebra modulo that ideal lifts to an algebra section.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Lemma Tag 09XI, implication (5) ⇒ (2)
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-gabber-root-criterion-etale-section-lifting).

Proof (the nine steps of the DAG node):
1. The section factors through `B/IB`. By `lem-weil-pbc-etale-ring-base-change` and
`lem-weil-pbc-etale-section-idempotent-splitting`, its associated idempotent `ε` gives
`B/IB ≅ A/I × C`, with the section the first projection.
2. Let `B'` be the integral closure of `A` in `B`. Finite presentation follows from
`lem-weil-pbc-etale-algebra-finite-presentation-localization`. Apply
`lem-weil-pbc-integral-closure-finite-fibre-part-localization` to obtain an idempotent
`ε'` modulo `IB'` mapping to `ε` and a lift `b` with `B'_b ≅ B_b`.
3. Choose a finite subalgebra `B''` containing `b`, the numerators of generators of `B'_b`,
and the finitely many elements expressing `b²-b` in `IB'`. Finiteness follows from
`lem-weil-pbc-finite-of-integral-generators`. Then `B''_b ≅ B'_b`, the image of `b` is
idempotent modulo `IB''`, and its first factor is `A/I`.
4. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-zariski-pair-finite-gabber-polynomial` to find `n ≥ 1` and a
polynomial `f = X^n(X-1) + ∑ aⱼ X^j`, with all `aⱼ ∈ I`, annihilating `b`.
5. The root hypothesis supplies `α` with `α-1 ∈ I`. The Jacobson condition makes `α`
a unit. Write `f = (X-α)g`; reduction gives `g mod I = X^n`, so `g(α)` is a unit.
The polynomial `E = g(α)⁻¹ g` satisfies `E²-E ∈ (f)` and `(X-α)E ∈ (f)`.
Thus `e = E(b)` is idempotent in `B'` and `be = αe`.
6. Modulo `I`, `E = X^n`, so `e` maps to `ε'^n = ε'`, since `n ≥ 1`.
Consequently its image in `B/IB` is `ε`.
7. On the `e` factor, `b = α` is invertible. Therefore `B'_e ≅ B_e` follows from
`B'_b ≅ B_b`. Since localization at an idempotent is a quotient, `B'_e`, and hence
`B_e`, is integral over `A`.
8. The map `A → B_e` is étale by
`lem-weil-pbc-etale-algebra-finite-presentation-localization`, flat by
`lem-weil-pbc-etale-algebra-flat`, and integral by step 7. Its reduction modulo `I`
is the identity of `A/I`. By `lem-weil-pbc-zariski-pair-flat-integral-isomorphism`,
it is an isomorphism.
9. Compose `B → B_e` with the inverse of this isomorphism. Its reduction agrees
with the original section, since both maps agree on the image of `A → B_e`,
which is surjective. This yields the required `τ`. -/
