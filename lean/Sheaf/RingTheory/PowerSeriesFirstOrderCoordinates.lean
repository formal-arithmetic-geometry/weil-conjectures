/-- Constant and linear coefficients identify power series modulo the square of the
variables' ideal with a trivial square-zero extension. The variables' ideal is precisely
the subspace with zero first coordinate.

Proof: Send a series f to (constantCoeff f, fun i ↦ coeff (Finsupp.single i 1) f).
The Cauchy product gives multiplication (c,v)(c',v') = (cc',cv' + c'v), so this
is a ring homomorphism to the trivial square-zero extension. It is surjective:
(c,v) is the image of C(c) + sum_i C(v_i) X_i. Its kernel is N². Indeed products
of two variables have zero constant and linear coefficients, so N² lies in the
kernel. Conversely order the finite variable set. For every monomial of total
degree at least two, choose its first two variable factors, allowing repetition.
Group the coefficients according to this pair and remove those two factors.
This gives finitely many well-defined series f_ij and the equality
f = sum_ij X_i X_j f_ij whenever the constant and linear terms of f vanish.
Thus f belongs to N². The first isomorphism theorem supplies e. Every element
of N has zero constant coefficient; conversely a class with zero first coordinate
has representative sum_i C(v_i) X_i, which belongs to N. This proves the stated
ideal membership criterion. For an empty variable set N = 0 and the constant
coefficient map itself is an isomorphism. -/
