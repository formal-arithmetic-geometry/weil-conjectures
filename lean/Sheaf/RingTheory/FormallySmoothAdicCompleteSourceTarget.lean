/-- A local map of Noetherian local rings induces a map between their maximal-ideal
completions, specified on every quotient coordinate. Formal smoothness for the target's
maximal-ideal adic topology passes to this map, with the extended target ideal.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 07ED, (1) implies (3).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-fs-adic-complete-source-target)

Proof: (1) Noetherianity makes both maximal ideals finitely generated. Locality sends
powers of the source maximal ideal into the corresponding target powers, so the induced
quotient maps form a compatible family and define the displayed completion homomorphism.
(2) By lem-weil-pbc-fs-adic-completion, completion of the target preserves adic formal
smoothness over the original source (07ED, (1) implies (2)).
(3) In a lifting problem over the completed source with square-zero ideal J, if the map
from the completed target to D/J kills the k-th power of the extended target ideal, the
structure map from the completed source to D kills its extended maximal ideal to power
2k: its k-th power maps into J and J squared is zero (07EC).
(4) Restrict the lifting problem to the original source and use step (2). The resulting
lift likewise kills the 2k-th power of the extended target ideal.
(5) By lem-weil-pbc-adic-completion-mod-power (05GG), every element of the completed
source agrees modulo its extended maximal ideal to power 2k with an original-source
element. The two maps to D agree on the original source and kill that power, hence agree
everywhere. The lift is therefore linear over the completed source, as required. -/
