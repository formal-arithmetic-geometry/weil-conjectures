/-- A Noetherian local ring is regular exactly when its strict henselization is regular.
Here `C` is the strict henselization of `R` with respect to the separable closure `K` of
the residue field of `R`.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Lemma 15.46.10 (Tag 06LN).

Proof: `lem-sc-strict-henselization-noetherian` makes the strict henselization Noetherian.
By `lem-sc-strict-henselization-dimension`, the two rings have equal Krull dimension.
By `lem-sc-strict-henselization-cotangent-dimension`, extension of the residue field
identifies the cotangent spaces and preserves their dimensions. Apply
`lem-weil-pbc-regular-local-cotangent-dimension` to both Noetherian local rings:
regularity is equality of cotangent-space dimension and Krull dimension. The two
comparisons therefore give the equivalence.
