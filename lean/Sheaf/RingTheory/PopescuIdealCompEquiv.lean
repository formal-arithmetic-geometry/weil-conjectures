/-- Precomposition with an algebra equivalence preserves the extended singular ideal.
Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps, Situation 07F7
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-ideal-comp-equiv).
Proof: Applying singularIdeal_map_equiv_le to the equivalence and its inverse gives
equality of the transported singular ideals. Ideal maps compose, so their images in
the target agree; taking radicals proves the result. -/
