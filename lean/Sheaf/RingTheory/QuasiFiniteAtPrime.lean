/-- (blueprint: def-weil-pbc-ring-map-quasi-finite-at-prime) For a finite-type map of
commutative rings `R → S`, quasi-finiteness at a prime `q` means that the prime of the
fibre ring `κ(p) ⊗[R] S` corresponding to `q`, where `p` is the contraction of `q`,
is an isolated point of its spectrum (Stacks, Tags 00PL and 00PK).

The fibre prime is supplied canonically by `PrimeSpectrum.preimageHomeomorphFiber`;
its source point lies over `p` by the definition of `p`. The singleton is open in
the Zariski topology of the fibre spectrum. -/
