# Normality ascends along etale ring maps

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 033C, applied as in More on Algebra,
Lemma Tag 06DI (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-etale-over-normal-ring-normal).

A normal ring (`def-weil-pbc-normal-ring`, Stacks Tags 0309 and 00GV) is written out
as in the landed `CommAlgCat.isDomain_isIntegrallyClosed_injective_of_etale_colimit`:
every localization at a prime ideal is an integrally closed domain.

/-- An etale algebra over a normal ring is normal: if `f : A →+* B` is etale and every
localization of `A` at a prime is an integrally closed domain, then so is every
localization of `B` at a prime.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 033C; More on Algebra, proof of Tag 06DI
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-etale-over-normal-ring-normal).

Proof:
1. The morphism of affine schemes induced by the ring map is etale
   (`def-weil-etale-morphism`), hence smooth by
   `lem-weil-pbc-etale-smooth-zero-dimensional-fibres`, in the sense of
   `def-sbc-smooth-morphisms`.
2. By `lem-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map-iff-smooth-affine`, the ring map is smooth in
   the sense of `def-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map`.
3. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-smooth-over-normal-ring-normal` (Stacks Tag 033C) to the smooth
   ring map and the normal base ring (`def-weil-pbc-normal-ring`). This gives normality
   of the target ring. The affine etale equivalence is Stacks Tag 02GJ (2). -/
