/-- The canonical special-chart map is surjective.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 07CP, polynomial elimination modulo pi
and comparison of the other chart relations.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-special-chart-map-surjective).

Proof: Write T for the localized lifting quotient and A for the localized
coefficient quotient. The canonical map sends every free variable z_j,
j in E_k, to its class in T and sends A by the localized coefficient map.
Each original variable x_i is in its image by hc and hcmod. Constants from R
are in its image because the maps are algebra maps. Polynomial induction on
R[x] therefore identifies the image of any original polynomial with its
coefficient image. In T the defining k-th relation, reduced modulo pi, reads
a_k z_l = sum over j in E_k of h_klj z_j. The image of a_k is invertible,
and its inverse is the image of the inverse in A. Thus every auxiliary z_l
is in the map's image, including those outside E_k. Polynomial induction on
R[x,z] shows that every element of the unlocalized lifting algebra is in the
image after passing through its defining quotient and ULift. Surjectivity of
the quotient by pi gives the same claim for D/pi D. Finally every element
of T is a fraction whose denominator is a power of the image of a_k; that
inverse already lies in the image. This proves surjectivity. No preparation,
conormal independence, normalization, or smoothness assumption is needed. -/
