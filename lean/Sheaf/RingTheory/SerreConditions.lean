# Serre's conditions for Noetherian rings

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Definition 10.157.1 (Tag 031P), parts (1) and (2);
height as local dimension, Definition 10.60.3 (Tag 00KF)
(blueprint: def-weil-pbc-serre-conditions-rk-sk).

## Main definitions

- `Ring.IsSerreR`: regularity in codimension at most `k`.
- `Ring.IsSerreS`: depth at least the minimum of `k` and local dimension.

/-- Serre's condition `(R_k)` for a Noetherian ring (Stacks, Tag 031P, part (1);

dimension of its localization (Stacks, Tag 00KF). -/

/-- Serre's condition `(S_k)` for a Noetherian ring (Stacks, Tag 031P, part (2);
(blueprint: def-weil-pbc-serre-conditions-rk-sk)). The depth is that of the local
ring as a module over itself, and `p.height` is its Krull dimension (Tag 00KF). -/
