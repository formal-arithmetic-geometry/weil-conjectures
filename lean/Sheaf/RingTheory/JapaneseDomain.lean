is finite as an `R`-module (Stacks, Tag 032F)

/-- An integral domain `R` with fraction field `K` is N-2, or Japanese, when for every
finite field extension `L/K`, the integral closure of `R` in `L` is finite as an `R`-module.
The `R`-algebra structure on `L` is required to be the composite through `K`.
