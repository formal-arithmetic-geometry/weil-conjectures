/-- The defect of a ring lift agreeing on generators of the base maximal ideal extends
to a derivation on the target. The displayed additive map is a Z-derivation with
values in J, using the T-action induced by f.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-closed-fiber-defect-derivation-extension)

Proof: Give J its T-module structure through f; square-zero makes this independent
of the representative of g. The annihilation hypothesis makes J a vector space over
K = T/m_T, and the local map makes its R-action factor through k = R/m_R.
The difference f composed with R -> T minus R -> D is additive, satisfies Leibniz,
and has values in J. It vanishes on t. Its differential functional therefore kills
the conormal image for m_R: the differentials of the generators t span this image,
and m_R acts trivially on J. The quotient differential exact sequence factors the
functional through Omega_(k/Z). Extend scalars to K. Adic formal smoothness of the
closed fibre gives injectivity of its base-field differential map after tensoring
with K (Tag 07EL). Extend the functional along this injection using a vector-space
basis, and precompose with the differential of T -> T/L. This gives the required
derivation delta on T, with the prescribed restriction. Its values lie in J,
Leibniz uses the f-action, and every derivation kills 1. For J = 0 use the zero map;
for t empty the base maximal ideal is zero and the same factorization applies.
