/-- Removing a finite part of a p-basis leaves exactly its bounded monomials as a basis.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 07P5, first proof paragraph; the explicit coefficient-field
argument in lem-weil-pbc-power-series-subring-finite-basis, step 1.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-p-basis-complement-monomial-basis).

Proof: Frobenius is a field homomorphism in characteristic p. Its image is the
subfield of p-th powers and contains the prime field, so the intermediate field
in hpb equals this image. Write F for that subfield. The F-span L of the bounded monomials
on I minus J contains 1 and all the complementary generators. Multiplication preserves
L: reduce exponents modulo p and put the removed p-th powers into F. If a is nonzero
in L, then a^p lies in F and a inverse equals (a^p) inverse times a^(p-1), so L is also
closed under inverses. Thus L is kJ, by the two inclusions with its generating set.
Every exponent function splits uniquely into its restrictions to J and its complement,
and its monomial is the product of the two monomials. Expand an element in the given
F-basis and group its finitely many coordinates by the J restriction. This proves
spanning over kJ. For independence, expand the finitely many kJ coefficients in the
complementary monomial span. The resulting relation in the original F-basis has
pairwise distinct exponent functions. Every F-coordinate therefore vanishes, so every
kJ coefficient vanishes. The indicated family is consequently a basis. If J is empty,
the single empty monomial is 1 and kJ is k, so the argument includes that case. -/
