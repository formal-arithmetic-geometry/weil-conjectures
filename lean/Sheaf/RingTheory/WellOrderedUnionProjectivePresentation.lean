/-- The filtration argument supplies a short exact projective presentation whose
kernel has the inductive bound. Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma 0D1U.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-well-ordered-union-succ-data).

Proof: the source takes free presentations of the stages. For the exact universe
generality here use projective presentations already supplied by `hquot` instead.
Put `U e = sup_{i < e} F i` and `Q e = F e / U e`. For each nonzero `Q e` take
the degree-zero term `P e` and the augmentation `a e : P e → Q e` of its supplied
length-`n+1` resolution; for a zero quotient take `P e = 0`. These are projective
objects in `ModuleCat.{v} R`. Lift `a e` through the quotient epimorphism
`F e → Q e` to a map `b e : P e → F e`. Let `P` be the external direct sum of
the `P e`, and `pi : P → M` the sum of the maps `b e` followed by stage inclusions.
Well-founded induction shows that `pi` maps the partial sum through index `e`
onto `F e`: subtract a lift of the quotient class; the remainder lies in a
preceding stage. Thus `pi` is surjective.

All these objects can be formed in universe `v`. Indeed, for each nonzero `Q e`
choose an element of `F e` outside `U e`. The chosen elements for different
indices differ, by monotonicity. The active index set therefore injects into
`M` and is small in `v`. Shrink that index set and its direct sum; the resulting
sum is categorical-projective by componentwise lifting against epimorphisms.
This avoids constructing a free R-module in universe `max u v` when `u > v`.

Let `K = ker pi` and let `G e` be its intersection with the partial sum through
`e`, pulled back into `K`. Finite supports have largest indices, so `G` is
monotone and covers `K`. The union of the preceding partial sums is the sum
strictly before `e`, and its image under `pi` is `U e`. Quotienting the kernel
sequence consequently gives an exact sequence
`0 → G e / G_{<e} → P e → Q e → 0`.
For the middle exactness, lift into the preceding partial sum the image of a
vector whose image in `Q e` is zero and subtract that lift. The difference is
in `K`. Injectivity is the equality of the intersection with the preceding
partial sum and the predecessor kernel union. Surjectivity is that of `a e`.

The kernel-filtration theorem identifies `G e / G_{<e}` with the augmentation
kernel of the chosen resolution of `Q e` at every active index; at an inactive
index it is zero. Truncate that chosen resolution, deleting degree zero, to
obtain a length-`n` resolution of its augmentation kernel. Transport it along
the supplied isomorphism. At an inactive index use the identity resolution of
the zero object. No Schanuel comparison or enough-projectives instance is needed.
Apply `hIH` to `K` and `G`, obtaining its length-`n` resolution.
Take the short complex with objects `K`, `P`, and exactly `M`, and arrows
the kernel inclusion and `pi`. The inclusion is injective, `pi` is surjective,
and its kernel is the image of the inclusion, so this complex is short exact.
Its middle term is projective and its first term has the required bound.
At `n = 0` this gives a projective kernel. Repeated stages have zero quotients;
an empty index type is excluded by the covering assumption applied to zero. -/
