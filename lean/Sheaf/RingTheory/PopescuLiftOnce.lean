/-- A map from a finitely presented algebra factors through `B / J`, with `B` smooth and
`J` finitely generated and contained in the extended square-zero base ideal, provided the
reduction of the target algebra is a filtered colimit of smooth algebras.

Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps, Lemma 16.5.1, Tag 07CK
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-lift-once).

Proof (the twelve steps of the node):
1. Reduce a finite polynomial presentation of `A` modulo `I`. This gives a finite
   presentation of `A / IA` over `R / I` and an induced map to `Λ / IΛ`.
2. Use lem-weil-pbc-colimit-standard-smooth-algebras (07CI) to express `Λ / IΛ` as a
   filtered colimit of standard smooth algebras. Use
   lem-weil-pbc-filtered-colimit-algebras-elementwise and
   lem-weil-pbc-finite-presentation-algebra-factors-filtered-colimit (00QO) to factor
   the reduced map through a standard smooth algebra `Bbar`.
3. By lem-weil-pbc-finite-presentation-over-finite-type-algebra (00F4), present `Bbar`
   by finitely many variables `t` and relations `gbar` over `A / IA`.
4. Lift the images of `t` to elements `λ` of `Λ` and lift `gbar` to polynomials `g`
   over `A`. Their evaluations lie in `IΛ`; write each as a finite sum `ε * μ`
   with `ε` in `I`.
5. Adjoin variables `δ` to `A[t]` and impose the relations `g - sum ε * δ`.
   The resulting algebra `A'` maps to `Λ` by `t ↦ λ`, `δ ↦ μ`, extending the original
   map. It is finitely presented over `R` by
   lem-weil-pbc-finite-presentation-base-change-composition.
6. Modulo `I`, the algebra `A'` is `Bbar[δ]`, hence standard smooth. Choose a
   standard smooth presentation with an invertible Jacobian minor determinant.
7. Lift its equations to `R`, and invert the lifted determinant by adjoining one
   variable with relation `x * determinant - 1`. The resulting algebra `B` is
   standard smooth: the enlarged Jacobian minor has determinant the square of the
   original determinant. It is smooth by lem-weil-pbc-standard-smooth-is-smooth.
8. Reduction identifies `B / IB` with `A' / IA'`: the extra variable is the inverse
   of the Jacobian determinant. Check the inverse maps on all generators.
9. By lem-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map-square-zero-lifting (00TN), lift the map
   `B → A' / IA'` to `θ : B → A'`, since `(IA')² = 0`. Its reduction is the
   isomorphism from step 8.
10. Apply lem-weil-pbc-nakayama-nilpotent (00DV) to conclude that `θ` is surjective.
11. Put `J = ker θ`. Injectivity modulo `I` gives `J ≤ IB`. Finite presentation of
    `A'` and lem-weil-pbc-finite-presentation-surjection-kernel-fg (00R2) show the
    kernel of the polynomial presentation mapping to `A'` is finitely generated.
    Its image under the surjection to `B` is `J`, so `J` is finitely generated.
12. Identify `B / J` with `A'` and compose the maps from `A` and to `Λ`.
    Their composite is the original algebra map by step 5. -/
