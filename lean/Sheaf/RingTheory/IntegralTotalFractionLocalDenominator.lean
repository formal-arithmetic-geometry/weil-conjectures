/-- Integral total fractions belong locally to any normal prime localization.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 031S, reverse implication, denominator clearing
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-integral-total-fraction-local-denominator).

Proof: Write x = a/b with b a nonzerodivisor. Put A = R_p and K = Frac(A).
The image of every nonzerodivisor s of R is nonzero in A: otherwise a multiplier
outside p kills s, forcing that multiplier to be zero, a contradiction. Thus the
map R → K extends to Q(R) → K. The image of x is integral over A by mapping a monic
integral equation, so integral closedness writes it as c/t with c in R and t outside p.
Write tx-c = d/e in Q(R). Its image in K is zero. Hence d maps to zero in A,
and there is u outside p with ud = 0. Multiplying gives (ut)x = uc in Q(R).
Take s = ut and a = uc. Neither factor lies in p, so s does not lie in p.
This also handles the zero ring vacuously, since it has no prime ideal. -/
