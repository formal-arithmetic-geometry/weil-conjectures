/-- Integral closure in a finite product of normal domains has normal prime localizations.

Proof: Transport the A-algebra structure to the product factors. Coordinate projection
maps integral elements to integral elements. Conversely, multiply one monic annihilating
polynomial for each coordinate; this monic product annihilates the tuple. Thus the integral
closure is the product of the coordinate integral closures. Each coordinate closure is a
normal domain: integrality is transitive, and an element integral over that closure belongs
to the ambient normal domain and hence to the closure. Every prime of the finite product
comes from one coordinate. Localization at that prime is the localization of that normal
domain, which is again an integrally closed domain. For an empty product there are no
prime ideals. -/
