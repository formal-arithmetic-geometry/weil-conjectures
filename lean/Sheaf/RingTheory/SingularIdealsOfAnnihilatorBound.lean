/-- For a finitely presented tower, an annihilator bound makes the relative and absolute
singular ideals contain the extension of the singular ideal of the intermediate algebra.
This comparison involves neither a source algebra `A` nor a factorization into `Λ`.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 07CT, second paragraph and final sentence of the proof.

Proof: Write `p = algebraMap R D π` and `M = Ann_D(p²)/Ann_D(p)`. Its annihilator is the
ideal of elements `r` such that `p² * x = 0` implies `r * p * x = 0` for every `x`.
Since `D` is Noetherian, `M` is finite. At a prime `q` where `D_q` is flat over `R`,
flat base change of annihilators (Tag 07T8) and `hR` give `M_q = 0`. The finite-module
support criterion (Tag 00L2) therefore supplies an element of `Ann_D(M)` outside `q`.
At a prime `Q` of `B` outside the extension of `H_{D/R}`, the inverse-image prime `q`
is smooth for `D/R`, hence `D_q` is flat over `R`. The preceding annihilator element
maps outside `Q`, and `hbound` puts it in `H_{B/D}`. Thus `D → B` is smooth at `Q`.
The nonsmooth-locus characterization of singular ideals and their radicality imply the
first containment. Smoothness of `R → D` at `q` and of `D → B` at `Q` implies smoothness
of `R → B` at `Q`: choose smooth principal neighbourhoods and localize both so that the
maps compose, using smooth base change and composition (Tags 00T4 and 00TD).
Apply the same radical/zero-locus criterion to get the second containment.
