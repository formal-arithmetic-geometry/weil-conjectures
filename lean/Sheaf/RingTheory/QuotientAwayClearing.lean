Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma 00SC, proof of (2) implies (1).
For J contained in I and A I contained in J, the canonical quotient map becomes
an isomorphism after inverting A B. Indeed A is a unit there, so every element of
I already vanishes in the localization of R/J. This gives an inverse map from
R/I and then from its localization by the universal property. Both composites
fix the base ring, hence are identities by quotient and localization uniqueness.
This remains valid for B=0, when both localizations are the zero ring. -/
