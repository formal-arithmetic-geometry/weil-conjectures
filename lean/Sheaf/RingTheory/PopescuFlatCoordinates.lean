/-- Choose an admissible subalgebra containing a finite set and flat polynomial coordinates
whose residue differentials span its differentials. This is the coordinate-construction part,
not the essentially smooth factorization, of Stacks Tag 07FH.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-flat-coordinates).

Proof: Localize the geometrically regular Noetherian algebra at q. Tensor products commute
with localization, and regularity is preserved by localization, so it remains geometrically
regular. Its prime-power quotient B is Artinian local, with maximal ideal the image of q.
The injectivity theorem 07E5 embeds H1 of its residue field into the finite conormal space
q/q²; consequently that H1 is finite dimensional. Apply 07FG and directedness to obtain an
admissible subalgebra A₀ containing the finite set E. Apply the corrected enlargement lemma
PopescuSolutionModuloChoose to A₀. This gives an admissible A containing A₀, elements of Λ
mapping into A whose residue differentials are a basis, and elements of q mapping into A
which generate qΛ_q. Use the basis elements as the first t polynomial coordinates. By 07E6
this polynomial localization maps flatly to Λ_q and its closed fibre is regular local.
Select from the q-generators a minimal set generating the maximal ideal of that fibre.
Nakayama and regular-local regularity make these a regular system of parameters and a
regular sequence. Append these elements as further coordinates. Their images generate the
closed-fibre maximal ideal, giving pΛ_q = qΛ_q. The closed fibre of the extended polynomial
localization over the first localization is the polynomial ring over κ(p') localized at its
origin, with parameters the added variables. The regular-sequence flatness criterion 07DY
makes its map to the regular closed fibre flat. Apply the Noetherian local fibre-flatness
criterion 00MP to conclude flatness of the extended localization map ψ. All coordinates
still map into A, and their differentials span because the first t already form a basis.
The maximal ideal of A is the contraction of the ambient maximal ideal: admissibility puts
it inside that contraction, which is proper because it excludes 1; maximality gives equality.
This proves every asserted property. No quotient factorization or étaleness is asserted. -/
