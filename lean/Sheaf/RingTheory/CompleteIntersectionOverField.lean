# Complete intersections over a field

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Definition 10.135.1 (Tag 00S9)
(blueprint: def-weil-pbc-complete-intersection-over-field).

## Main definitions

* `Algebra.IsGlobalCompleteIntersection`: a polynomial presentation of the expected dimension,
  including the zero ring by convention.
* `Algebra.IsLocalCompleteIntersection`: a cover by principal opens whose localizations are
  global complete intersections.

Definition 10.135.1 (Tag 00S9), part (1): a commutative `k`-algebra is a global complete
intersection if it is the zero ring, or is isomorphic as a `k`-algebra to a quotient of
`k[x₁, ..., xₙ]` by `c` polynomials and has Krull dimension `n - c`. The inequality `c ≤ n`
expresses that this integer difference is nonnegative for a nonzero ring. -/

Definition 10.135.1 (Tag 00S9), part (2): a finite type `k`-algebra is a local complete
intersection if its spectrum is covered by principal opens `D(g)` and every corresponding
localization is a global complete intersection over `k`. -/
