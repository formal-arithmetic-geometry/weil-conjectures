/-- For a one-dimensional Noetherian domain, only finitely many maximal ideals contain
any fixed nonzero element (Stacks, Tag 00PF).
(blueprint: lem-sc-finite-maximals-over-element)

Proof: For `I = xR`, the minimal primes over `I` form a finite set by
`lem-sc-finite-minimal-primes-over-ideal`. Any maximal ideal containing `x` contains one
of these minimal primes by `lem-weil-pbc-prime-contains-minimal-prime`. Since `R` is a domain,
that prime is nonzero; the dimension-one hypothesis forces it to equal the maximal ideal.
Thus the maximal ideals in question form a subset of a finite set. -/
