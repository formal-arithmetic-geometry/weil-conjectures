/-- A Cohen ring modulo `p ^ n` is formally smooth over `ZMod (p ^ n)` for `n ≥ 1`.
The Cohen-ring hypothesis is `IsCohenRing p Λ` (prime `p`, DVR, maximal ideal `pΛ`,
`pΛ`-adically complete). The first clause is formal smoothness of `ℤ/p^n → Λ/p^nΛ`
(`Algebra.FormallySmooth`, the case `𝔫 = 0` of the adic notion); the second spells out
the same property for ring homomorphisms in an arbitrary target universe.
The `ZMod (p ^ n)`-algebra structure on the quotient exists and is unique, so the first
clause quantifies over it without adding a hypothesis or choosing auxiliary data.

Proof route from the DAG:
1. Define P(m) to be the displayed square-zero lifting property. A ring with `p ^ m = 0`
is uniquely a `ZMod (p ^ m)`-algebra, and every ring map between such rings is linear.
By `Algebra.FormallySmooth.iff_comp_surjective`, formal smoothness is this lifting property.
2. The Cohen-ring hypotheses give a residue field of characteristic p. They also imply
that Λ is torsion-free over ℤ: integers prime to p are units, while p is nonzero in the
DVR, hence no nonzero integer kills a nonzero element of Λ.
3. P(1) follows from `lem-weil-pbc-field-char-p-nilpotent-lifting` for the residue field
and nilpotence exponent 2 (Stacks Tag 0322).
4. By `lem-weil-pbc-pid-torsion-free-module-flat`, Λ is flat over ℤ; then
`lem-weil-pbc-flat-module-quotient-flat` makes Λ/p^mΛ flat over ℤ/p^mℤ.
5. Assuming P(n), apply `lem-weil-pbc-lift-formal-smoothness-flat-square-zero`
(Stacks Tag 031L) to ℤ/p^(n+1)ℤ → Λ/p^(n+1)Λ and I = (p^n). The ideal I is square-zero
since 2n ≥ n+1, flatness is step 4, and reduction modulo I is the map for exponent n.
Thus P(n+1) holds.
6. Induction from step 3 proves P(n) for every n ≥ 1, and step 1 identifies the first
clause with this explicit lifting condition. Completeness is retained as part of the
Cohen-ring hypothesis, although this proof uses only its DVR and uniformizer clauses. -/
