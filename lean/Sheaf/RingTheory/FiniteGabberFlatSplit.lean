/-- A flat neighbourhood preserving the quotient splits the finite algebra into two
factors. The first factor admits a scalar lift of `b - 1`, and `b` in the second factor
belongs to the extended ideal. The kernels of the two factor projections have zero
intersection. No polynomial relation or faithful flatness is asserted here.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-gabber-flat-split-neighbourhood)

Proof:
1. Finiteness makes B integral. Apply 07M4 to the idempotent represented by b
   modulo IB. This gives an etale A-algebra A' preserving A/I, and an idempotent
   in B tensor_A A' reducing to (1,0).
2. The idempotent decomposes the tensor algebra into its quotient by (1-e') and
   its quotient by e'. Both factors are finite over A'. Their reductions are B1
   and B2, and the image of b reduces respectively to 1 and 0.
3. The cokernel of A' -> the first factor is finite and equals IA' times itself,
   because A/I -> B1 is surjective. Nakayama 00DV gives g with g-1 in IA' which
   annihilates this cokernel. Localize A' and both factors at g to obtain C.
4. C is flat over A: etale algebras and localizations are flat, and flatness
   composes. Since g reduces to 1, A/I -> C/IC is still an isomorphism, agreeing
   with the structure map on representatives.
5. The first structure map is now surjective: y/g^n is the image of a/g^(n+1)
   whenever gy is the image of a. Its extended ideal is therefore the image of
   IC, so lift the first component of b-1 to a in IC. Let K and L be the kernels
   of the two factor projections from C tensor_A B. Their intersection is zero.
   The first equality says b-1-a belongs to K. The second component of b is in
   IC times that factor, equivalently b belongs to L plus the extended ideal.
   These conclusions also hold when either factor is the zero ring. -/
