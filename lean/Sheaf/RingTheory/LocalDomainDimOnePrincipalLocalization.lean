/-- Let `B` be a local domain of Krull dimension one with fraction field `K`, and let
`0 ≠ f` lie in the maximal ideal of `B`. Then the localization map `B_f → K` (the lift of
`algebraMap B K` to `Localization.Away f`, defined since `f` maps to a unit of `K`) is an
isomorphism.

(blueprint: lem-sc-local-domain-dim-one-principal-localization-fraction-field).

Proof:
1. Since `B` is a domain, `(0)` is prime. A nonzero prime `q` satisfies `(0) ⊊ q`, so by
   dimension one no prime lies strictly above `q`; hence `q` is maximal, and by locality
   `q = m`. The only primes of `B` are `(0)` and `m`.
2. By the prime correspondence for localization (`lem-weil-pbc-primes-of-localization`,
   with `B` local so `B_m = B`), the primes of `B_f` are the primes of `B` not containing
   `f`: `m` is excluded since `f ∈ m`, `(0)` is allowed since `f ≠ 0`. So `(0)` is the
   only prime of `B_f`.
3. `B_f` is a domain whose only prime is `(0)`, so every nonzero element is a unit and
   `B_f` is a field. The map `B_f → K` is injective (a power of `f ≠ 0` kills no nonzero
   numerator), and every fraction `a / b` with `b ≠ 0` lies in its image since the image
   of `b` in the field `B_f` is invertible. So the map is an isomorphism. -/
