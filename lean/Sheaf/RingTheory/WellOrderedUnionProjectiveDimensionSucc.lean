/-- Successor step in Auslander's well-ordered union argument.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma 0D1U, the positive-bound case; Lemma 065S (1).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-well-ordered-union-succ-step).

Proof: the source takes free presentations of the stages. For the exact universe
generality here use projective presentations already supplied by `hquot` instead.
Put `U e = sup_{i < e} F i` and `Q e = F e / U e`. For each nonzero `Q e` take
the degree-zero term `P e` and the augmentation `a e : P e → Q e` of its supplied
length-`n+1` resolution; for a zero quotient take `P e = 0`. These are projective
objects in `ModuleCat.{v} R`. Lift `a e` through the quotient epimorphism
`F e → Q e` to a map `b e : P e → F e`. Let `P` be the external direct sum of
the `P e`, and `pi : P → M` the sum of the maps `b e` followed by stage inclusions.
Well-founded induction shows that `pi` maps the partial sum through index `e`
onto `F e`: subtract a lift of the quotient class; the remainder lies in a
preceding stage. Thus `pi` is surjective.

All these objects can be formed in universe `v`. Indeed, for each nonzero `Q e`
choose an element of `F e` outside `U e`. The chosen elements for different
indices differ, by monotonicity. The active index set therefore injects into
`M` and is small in `v`. Shrink that index set and its direct sum; the resulting
sum is categorical-projective by componentwise lifting against epimorphisms.
This avoids constructing a free R-module in universe `max u v` when `u > v`.

Let `K = ker pi` and let `G e` be its intersection with the partial sum through
`e`, pulled back into `K`. Finite supports have largest indices, so `G` is
monotone and covers `K`. The union of the preceding partial sums is the sum
strictly before `e`, and its image under `pi` is `U e`. Quotienting the kernel
sequence consequently gives an exact sequence
`0 → G e / G_{<e} → P e → Q e → 0`.
For the middle exactness, lift into the preceding partial sum the image of a
vector whose image in `Q e` is zero and subtract that lift. The difference is
in `K`. Injectivity is the equality of the intersection with the preceding
partial sum and the predecessor kernel union. Surjectivity is that of `a e`.

Dimension shifting for this projective presentation gives a length-`n` resolution
of `G e / G_{<e}`. Concretely, compare the presentation with the initial arrow
of the supplied resolution of `Q e`; Schanuel identifies their kernels after
adding the projective degree-zero terms. The supplied kernel has the truncated
length-`n` resolution, so adding projectives and taking the complementary direct
summand gives the required bound (the argument of Lemma 065S (1)). This argument
stays in `ModuleCat.{v} R` and needs no enough-projectives instance.
Apply `hIH` to `K` and `G`. Splice its length-`n` resolution with `K → P → M`:
put `P` in degree zero and shift the kernel resolution up by one. Exactness at
`P` is `range(K → P) = ker pi`; exactness at the next term uses injectivity of
the kernel inclusion. All other exactness statements are unchanged. All terms
are projective and degrees above `n+1` are zero, as required.

At `n = 0` the kernel resolution is the identity resolution of a projective
kernel, giving the usual two-term resolution. Zero or repeated stages contribute
zero summands. An empty index type is excluded by `hcover` applied to zero. -/
