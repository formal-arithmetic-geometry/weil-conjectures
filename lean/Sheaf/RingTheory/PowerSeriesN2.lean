/-- Over a Noetherian N-2 domain, the one-variable formal power series ring is a
Noetherian N-2 domain. Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 032Q
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-power-series-n2).

Proof:
1. By `lem-weil-pbc-power-series-noetherian` and `lem-weil-pbc-power-series-domain`
   with one variable, the power series ring is Noetherian and a domain.
2. Let R' be the integral closure of R in its fraction field. The N-2 hypothesis
   makes R' finite over R. It is normal by
   `lem-weil-pbc-integral-closure-finite-extension-normal`, Noetherian by
   `lem-weil-pbc-finite-algebra-noetherian`, and N-2 by
   `lem-weil-pbc-n2-ascends-finite-domain-extension`.
3. Choose finitely many R-module generators r_j of R'. For each coefficient a_k
   of a series over R', write a_k as a linear combination of the r_j over R.
   Collecting the coefficient sequences gives series g_j over R and expresses
   the original series as the finite sum of r_j g_j. Thus R'[[x]] is finite over R[[x]].
4. By `lem-weil-pbc-power-series-normal-domain`, R'[[x]] is a Noetherian normal domain.
5. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-tate-n2-complete-principal` to x in R'[[x]]. Its quotient
   by x is R', by `lem-weil-pbc-power-series-quotient-variables`, and is therefore
   an N-2 domain. The ring is x-adically complete by
   `lem-weil-pbc-power-series-variables-complete`. Hence R'[[x]] is N-2.
6. By `lem-weil-pbc-n2-descends-finite-domain-extension`, the finite extension
   R[[x]] into R'[[x]] descends N-2 to R[[x]], completing all three conclusions. -/
