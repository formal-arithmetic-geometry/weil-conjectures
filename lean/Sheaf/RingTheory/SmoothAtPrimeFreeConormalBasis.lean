/-- Near a smooth prime of a polynomial quotient, selected defining equations form a
basis of the localized conormal module, and the differentials are free of complementary rank.
Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps, Lemma Tag 07C6
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-smooth-at-prime-free-conormal-basis).

Proof, following the four steps of the node:
1. Choose a smooth principal neighbourhood using `IsSmoothAtPrime`. The lemma
   `lem-weil-pbc-smooth-localization-conormal-split` makes the conormal module and the
   differential module direct summands of the free module of rank n, hence finite projective.
2. The given relations span the conormal fibre at q. Choose a subset V giving a basis
   of cardinality c. Tensoring the split sequence with the residue field shows c ≤ n
   and differential fibre dimension n-c; the subset condition also gives c ≤ m.
3. Finite projective modules are finitely presented and locally free
   (`lem-weil-pbc-finite-projective-finitely-presented` and
   `lem-weil-pbc-finite-projective-rank-locally-constant`). The conormal rank at q is c.
   Use `lem-weil-pbc-prescribed-residue-basis-spreads` to spread the selected classes
   to a basis outside q. Clear denominators and combine localization elements.
   Smoothness persists by `lem-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map-principal-localization`.
4. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-finitely-presented-free-at-prime-spreads` to the differential
   module of rank n-c. Clear denominators and take a common shrink, preserving the
   selected conormal basis and smoothness. Identify the resulting differentials using
   `lem-weil-pbc-kahler-differentials-localization`.
