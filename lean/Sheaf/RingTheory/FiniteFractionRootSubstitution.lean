/-- Finitely many rational functions acquire prescribed p-power roots after a finite
coefficient extension and the substitution X ↦ T^(p^n).

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 032O, the coefficient-root construction in the
second assertion, with the omitted finite-coefficient argument expanded.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-fraction-root-substitution)

Proof. Put K = Frac(R). Write each fraction as a quotient of polynomials over R.
In an algebraic closure of K adjoin the p^n-th roots of the finite union of their
nonzero coefficients. Each root is integral over K because its positive p^n-th
power is in K; the finite algebraic-generators theorem makes the generated subfield
E finite over K. Give E the R-algebra structure induced through K. Each chosen root
is also integral over R, since its p^n-th power is the image of a coefficient in R.
Thus the roots already belong to A = integralClosure R E. The coefficient map R → A
is injective. Polynomial expansion by the positive integer p^n is injective, so
mapping coefficients and substituting X ↦ T^(p^n) gives an injective map R[X] → A[T].
Extend its composite with A[T] → Frac(A[T]) to fractions by IsFractionRing.lift.
For each numerator and denominator, Polynomial.mem_map_range lifts its coefficient
image along iterated Frobenius on A. If Q is the lifted polynomial, the identity
map_iterateFrobenius_expand shows Q^(p^n) equals the substituted original polynomial.
The quotient of the lifted polynomials therefore has p^n-th power equal to the image
of the original fraction, by compatibility of ring homomorphisms with powers and
division. All subfields and fraction fields stay in Type u. This construction also
handles n=0, empty families and zero numerators; no nonzero numerator is assumed. -/
