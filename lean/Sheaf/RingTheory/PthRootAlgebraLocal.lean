/-- The actual polynomial quotient adjoining the specified p-th roots. -/
abbrev pthRootAlgebra (p n : ℕ) (A : Type u) [CommRing A] (a : Fin n → A) :=
  MvPolynomial (Fin n) A ⧸ Ideal.span (Set.range (fun i : Fin n ↦
    (MvPolynomial.X i : MvPolynomial (Fin n) A) ^ p - MvPolynomial.C (a i)))

/-- Adjoining finitely many p-th roots to a local ring in characteristic p gives
another local ring, and the coefficient map is local.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-pth-root-algebra-local).

Proof: Map A to the algebraic closure of its residue field, and choose p-th roots
there of the images of the a_i. Evaluation at these roots kills the defining ideal
and induces a ring map g from the actual quotient to this field. This proves that
the quotient is nontrivial. Its composite with the coefficient map is the residue
map followed by the field embedding, so a coefficient whose image in the quotient
is a unit has nonzero residue and is itself a unit.

The quotient has characteristic p. Polynomial induction, using the defining
relations and the Frobenius identity for sums, shows that every b in the quotient
satisfies b^p = c for a coefficient c. In A, either c or 1-c is a unit. Mapping this
unit to the quotient shows that either b^p or (1-b)^p is a unit, hence either b or
1-b is a unit. This is the local-ring criterion. The proof works unchanged for
n = 0, for nilpotent coefficients, and for nonreduced A. -/
