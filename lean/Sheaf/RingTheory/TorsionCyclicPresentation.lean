/-- An ideal-power torsion module has a surjection from a direct sum of positive-power
ideal quotients, with ideal-power torsion kernel and the resulting short exact sequence.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 05E8, proof, first two sentences
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-torsion-cyclic-presentation).

Proof: Index the summands by the elements `q` of `Q`. Choose the least positive `n_q`
annihilating `q`. The map `R / I ^ n_q → Q` taking the class of `r` to `r • q` is well
defined and linear, since every element of `I ^ n_q` kills `q`
[def-weil-pbc-quotient-module]. Combine these maps by the direct sum universal property
[def-weil-pbc-direct-sum-modules]; the image of `1` in the `q`-summand is `q`, so the
resulting map is surjective. By direct-sum induction, zero is killed by `I ^ 1`,
a single summand is killed by its defining ideal power, and a sum of elements killed
by `I ^ m` and `I ^ l` is killed by `I ^ max m l`. Indeed, the latter ideal power
is contained in each of the former powers. Thus the direct sum and its kernel are
ideal-power torsion. The kernel inclusion and the surjective presentation map form
a short exact sequence [def-weil-pbc-exact-sequence], by Mathlib's
`LinearMap.shortExact_shortComplexKer`. -/
