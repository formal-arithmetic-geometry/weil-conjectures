/-- The presentation construction preceding square-zero lifting in Popescu's lemma.

Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps, Lemma 16.5.1, Tag 07CK,
proof lines 1255--1296 (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-lift-once-core).

Proof: Reduce a finite presentation of `A` modulo `I`. Express the target reduction
as a filtered colimit of standard smooth algebras using Tag 07CI, and factor the
reduced map through one stage by finite presentation (Tag 00QO). This stage is
finitely presented over `A / IA` by Tag 00F4; write it as `(A / IA)[t] / (gbar)`.
Lift its finitely many generators to `Lambda`, and lift the relations to `A[t]`.
Their evaluations lie in `I Lambda`, hence each is a finite sum `epsilon * mu`
with `epsilon` in `I`. Define `A' = A[t, delta] / (g - sum epsilon * delta)`;
evaluation at the chosen lifts and at `mu` gives `phi'`, extending `phi`.
There are finitely many generators and relations, so `A'` is finitely presented
by composition (Tag 00F4). Modulo `I` it is the standard smooth stage with the
variables `delta` adjoined, so it has a standard smooth presentation
`(R / I)[x] / (fbar)` with invertible Jacobian minor `Dbar`.
Lift the equations to `R[x]`, with Jacobian minor `D`, and set
`B = R[x, z] / (f, z * D - 1)`. The enlarged Jacobian minor has determinant
`D^2`, a unit in `B`, so `B` is standard smooth and thus smooth (Tag 00T7).
Reduction identifies `B / IB` with `A' / IA'`: send `x` to the presentation
generators and `z` to the inverse of `Dbar`; the inverse sends the presentation
generators to `x`. Both composites fix every generator, including `z` by uniqueness
of the inverse of `Dbar`. These are `R`-algebra maps. No square-zero hypothesis is
used in this presentation construction, only in the subsequent lifting. -/
