/-- Removing degree zero from a length-`n+1` projective resolution gives a
length-`n` projective resolution of its augmentation kernel. This works in an
independent module universe and needs no enough-projectives instance.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma 0D1U, successor argument; Lemma 065S (1).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-projective-resolution-augmentation-kernel).

Proof: truncate the given complex by setting the new degree `i` to its old
degree `i+1`. Factor the old differential `P_1 → P_0` through the kernel of
`P_0 → M`. Exactness of the augmentation makes this factorization surjective.
The next differential has the same kernel after this factorization, since the
kernel inclusion is monic. Thus the truncated augmentation is exact. All higher
exactness assertions are those of the supplied resolution with indices shifted
by one, and all terms remain projective. The old vanishing bound `n+1 < i+1`
is precisely the new bound `n < i`. -/
