/-- Localize a finite extension after inverting one element outside a maximal ideal.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 0334, Step 5, localization of S subset S'.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-away-maximal-localization).

Proof: Put S0 = S_s and p = mS0. Since s is outside m, p is maximal, its contraction
is m, and (S0)_p is canonically S_m. Put h = g composed with S -> S0 and invert the
image M = h(S minus m) in T. The localization universal property gives the canonical
map S_m -> M^-1 T. It is injective since S -> S0 and g are injective. Localizing the
finite set of S0-module generators of T gives finite generation over S_m, because s
is already invertible there. Thus this map is integral. Every maximal ideal q of M^-1 T
contracts to the unique maximal ideal of S_m. The contraction n0 of q to T is prime,
and its contraction to S0 is p. Indeed the elements of m map into q by the contraction
to S_m, and every element outside m maps to a unit; clearing powers of s gives the
assertion on S0. Since T is integral over S0 and p is maximal, n0 is maximal. The same
contraction identity gives m.map h <= n0. -/
