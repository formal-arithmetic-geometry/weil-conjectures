/-- A finite purely inseparable base change of a nonzero polynomial formal fibre above
zero is a finite product of linear-residue formal fibres over complete local domains.
This is a ring presentation, with no regularity assertion.

Proof:
Fix L/κ(r) as in the statement. Since r is nonzero and above zero, its extension to
K[X] is a nonzero maximal ideal, where K is the fraction field of A. Thus κ(r), and
hence L, is finite over K. Choose finitely many generators of L/K. Multiply them by
a common nonzero coefficient denominator to make them integral over A, by clearing
the coefficients of their monic equations with successive powers of the denominator.
Their generated A-subalgebra B inside L is finite over A, a domain, and has fraction
field L. Tag 0325 makes it Noetherian, local and complete, with its unique maximal
ideal above that of A. Evaluation B[X] → L sends X to its image in κ(r). Its prime
kernel s contracts to zero in B; it is nonzero because a nonzero element of r remains
nonzero under the injective coefficient extension A[X] → B[X]. The image B[X]/s
contains B inside L, so its fraction field, hence κ(s), is L. The canonical B-algebra
structure on κ(s) therefore makes it a fraction field of B.
Apply Tag 07N9 to the finite extension A[X] → B[X] at q. Its completion base change
is a finite product of the completions at primes qᵢ above q. Each qᵢ is maximal by
integrality. Its contraction to B is the unique prime above the maximal ideal of A,
hence the maximal ideal of B. Tensor with L and use associativity and finite-product
distributivity to identify L ⊗[κ(r)] r.Fiber C with the product of the s-fibres of
these completions. If s is not contained in qᵢ, an element of s outside qᵢ is both
zero and invertible in the fibre, so that factor is zero. Removing zero factors from
a product is a ring isomorphism, with the unique zero coordinate supplied by its
inverse. Index the remaining finitely many qᵢ by Fin n; for each let Bᵢ be a copy of
B, sᵢ a copy of s, and retain the indicated qᵢ. All requested structures and ideal
relations follow from the construction. No factors is permitted: the empty product
is the zero ring. All rings Bᵢ lie in the universe of L, as subalgebras of L. -/
