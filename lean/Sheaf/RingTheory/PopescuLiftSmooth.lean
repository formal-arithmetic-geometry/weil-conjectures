/-- The prepared quotient, with the specified generator map, has all three smoothness
properties. This is about `d.liftingAlgebra`, never an arbitrary algebra D.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 07CP, key equality through the end of the proof;
the original DAG steps 8--18.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-lift-smooth).

Proof: Expanding the cleared relations gives πp_{kl}=-a_k(f_l-πz_l)+Σh_{klj}(f_j-πz_j).
After inverting π the p equations are redundant and z_j=π⁻¹f_j, so D[1/π] is
R[1/π][x], proving smoothness away from π. For a fixed chart k form D_k using
f_j-πz_j only for j in E_k and p_{kl} only for l outside E_k. Normalization makes
p_{kl}=0 for l in E_k, so there are exactly m relations in n+m variables. Modulo π
and after inverting a_k, solve for the z_l outside E_k. The resulting ring is
(Cbar/πCbar)_{a_k}[z_j : j in E_k], with the generator map in the statement.
The smooth chart and the complementary differential basis give, after base change,
a smooth fibre of dimension (n-|E_k|)+|E_k|=n. Equation count gives flatness at
primes containing π and avoiding a_k; the flat smooth fibre criterion gives
smoothness of R → D_k there. The key equality makes all f_l-πz_l vanish in
(D_k)_{a_k}. For another chart k', compute the relation among the conormal basis
with coefficients a_{k'}h_{klj}-Σh_{k'lj'}h_{kj'j}. Basis independence makes these
coefficients zero in the localized reduced quotient. Clear denominators, using
the cleared f relations, to put a power of a_k times each coefficient in I_E+π²P.
Expanding the p equations now puts p_{k'l} in π(D_k)_{a_k}. It is also killed by π
by the key equality. The smooth local ring is flat over R, so flat base change of
annihilators carries Ann_R(π)=Ann_R(π²) to that local ring, forcing p_{k'l}=0.
Thus every generator of the kernel D_k → D vanishes locally. This finite kernel
is killed on a principal neighbourhood outside the prime, where the quotient
map is an isomorphism. Transfer the two smoothness properties of D_k to D by
principal localization. Finally the cover property selects such a chart for
every prime in the special fibre lying over the smooth locus of Cbar. The generator
identity and cmod compatibility identify the special-fibre algebra structures.
ULift is an algebra equivalence and preserves all the constructions and properties.
