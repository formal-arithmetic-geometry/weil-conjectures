(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-polynomial-quotient-smooth).

Proof: write `P=A[X_i,Z_ij]` and impose the finitely many displayed relations. The
finite presentation of A over k, together with the finitely many Z variables and
relations, gives a finite presentation over R=k[X_i]. For each generator a_j,
A_(a_j) is smooth over k because a_j belongs to H_(A/k). Invert a_j and solve each
relation uniquely for Z_ij; this identifies B_(a_j) with a polynomial ring in the
remaining Z variables over A_(a_j)[X_i]. Smoothness follows by base change,
polynomial smoothness and composition. In B_(X_i), the equation X_i^n=Σ Z_ij a_j
shows that the images of all a_j generate the unit ideal. Smoothness is local on
this principal cover, so B_(X_i) is smooth over R. If m=0, that equation says
X_i^n=0; its localization is the zero ring, which is smooth over R. If d=0,
there are no relations or X opens and the construction is A itself. These
arguments apply also when A or a localization is the zero ring. -/
