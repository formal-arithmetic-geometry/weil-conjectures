/-- There is a unique comparison with Koszul normalization, without regularity assumptions.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 09PQ, the resolution-independent strictly commutative Tor
algebra, and the boundary identification Tor_1(A/I,A/I) = I/I² used with Tag 062I.
(blueprint: new-r4-self-tor-conormal-comparison).

Proof: Resolve A/I by a Tate free strictly commutative dg algebra. A lift of an ideal
element to degree one gives a cycle after tensoring with A/I. Changing the lift changes
its homology class by a boundary; the quotient exact sequence identifies this class
with the ideal element modulo I². Multiply n such classes. Strict commutativity makes
this product alternating, including in characteristic two, and it is A/I-multilinear.
The exterior universal property therefore gives the displayed A-linear map. Comparison
of resolutions identifies the product with the top Koszul wedge for every tuple g:
the map from the Koszul dg algebra to the Tate resolution sends each generator to its
chosen degree-one lift. Every chain lift a has the same effect on homology, because
the source is a bounded complex of projective modules and two lifts of its augmentation
to a projective resolution are chain homotopic. Thus the map has the displayed
normalization for every P and a. Conversely these lifts exist, and every pure wedge of
conormal classes has lifts in I. The normalization determines every pure wedge, so
exterior generation gives uniqueness. For n=0 it is the quotient unit; zero quotients
and the zero ideal satisfy the same construction. -/
