/-- In a polynomial ring over a field, prime heights are at most the number of variables,
and every saturated chain between two primes has the difference of their heights.
The chain `p = c 0 < c 1 < ⋯ < c t = q` is an `LTSeries` in `PrimeSpectrum P` (the chain
form of the landed sibling `finiteTypeDomain_ringKrullDim_localizationAtMaximal`), its
length `t` is `c.length`, and `c i.castSucc ⋖ c i.succ` (`CovBy`) says that no prime lies
strictly between consecutive members.

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 00OR (label
`lemma-dimension-height-polynomial-ring`)
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-polynomial-ring-maximal-chain-height-difference).

Proof (the six steps of the node):
1. By `lem-weil-pbc-polynomial-ring-field-regular-ring` (00OQ), the polynomial
   ring is Noetherian and its localization at each prime is regular local,
   with its maximal ideal generated by dimension-many elements.
2. These generators form a regular sequence by
   `lem-weil-pbc-regular-local-generators-regular-sequence` (00NQ), so each
   localization has depth at least its dimension; dimension zero uses the empty sequence.
3. By `lem-weil-pbc-localization-dimension-chains-below-prime`, prime height is
   the finite dimension of that localization. Height is monotone by its chain
   definition. By `lem-weil-pbc-proper-ideal-contained-in-maximal`, put the upper
   prime inside a maximal ideal; its localization has dimension `n` by
   `lem-weil-pbc-polynomial-ring-maximal-localization-dimension` (00OP).
   This proves the height bound.
4. Since the lower height `h` is finite, a chain realizes it. It ends at the
   lower prime, starts at `(0)` by `lem-weil-pbc-polynomial-ring-domain`, and is
   saturated: otherwise appending, prepending, or inserting a prime would
   give a chain of length `h + 1`, contradicting the height definition.
5. Concatenate this chain with the given one. By
   `lem-weil-pbc-primes-of-localization` (00E3), it becomes a saturated chain
   of length `h + t` in the localization at the upper prime, from its least
   prime to its maximal ideal. Thus it is a maximal chain there.
6. By `lem-weil-pbc-cm-local-maximal-chain-length` (00N9), its length is the
   dimension of this Cohen--Macaulay local ring, hence the upper height.
   Subtract the lower height from `h + t = q.height` to conclude.
