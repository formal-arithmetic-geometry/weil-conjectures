/-- The splitting construction supplies one normal Nagata coefficient ring and a localized
fractional monogenic algebra, finite over the original maximal localization. Its maximal
ideals contract to maximal ideals containing z-r for a coefficient r in that ring.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-monogenic-splitting-cover).

Proof: Contract m to R. The residue of x is algebraic over the fraction field of R/(m ∩ R)
by Zariski's lemma. Lift its monic minimal polynomial, clearing all coefficient denominators
by a product s outside m ∩ R. Over R_s its evaluation at x belongs to mS_s. Take a finite
splitting extension L of K, and let R' be the integral closure of R_s in L. Localization
preserves Nagata rings, and the N-2 clause makes R' finite over R_s. Thus R' is normal and
Nagata, and L is its fraction field. Set z to the image of x and T = R'[z]. The finite module
generators of R' over R_s also generate T over S_s. Let M be the image in T of S minus m,
and put B = Localization M. The denominator s is already a unit in S_m, so localization
of that finite extension makes B finite over S_m. All maps embed in L, so M contains no
zero and the map S_m to B is injective. A maximal q of B contracts to a maximal n0 of T:
B is integral over the local ring S_m, so q contracts to its unique maximal ideal; n0 lies
over the maximal ideal of S_s and is maximal by integrality of T over S_s. The lifted monic
polynomial evaluates into n0 and splits into linear factors with roots in R'. Its positive
degree and primality of n0 imply z-r belongs to n0 for one root r. The conclusion records
this root r and the maximality of n0. Use universe lifts
of R_s and L as needed to place both coefficient rings in Type(max u v).
No normal principal open of B is asserted here; that follows separately by clearing a
denominator of z over R'. -/
