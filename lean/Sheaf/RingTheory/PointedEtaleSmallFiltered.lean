/-- The category of etale algebras pointed in the chosen residue separable closure
is essentially small and filtered.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 04GW, proof of
`lemma-strict-henselization-different`.
(blueprint: lem-sc-pointed-etale-small-filtered).

Proof: Identify an object with its etale algebra, the kernel of its map to `K`,
and the induced residue-field embedding. This identifies the category with the
etale residue triples at the maximal ideal. Finite presentation and essential
smallness of the affine etale site give a small set of representatives; the
maps to `K` over each representative form a set. The identity algebra is an
object. Tensor products give common successors. For two parallel maps
`S → S'`, the etale algebra `(S' ⊗[S] S') ⊗[S' ⊗[R] S'] S'` equalizes them;
the compatible maps to `K` extend to this algebra. These are precisely the
nonemptiness, common-successor and equalization conditions for filteredness. -/
