/-- If a set of elements with smooth principal localizations spans the target ideal,
then the target algebra is smooth, allowing different universes.

Proof source: the finite principal-cover criterion for smooth ring maps
(Mathlib's `FinitePresentation.of_span_eq_top_target` together with the smooth
locus criteria). These declarations are universe-polymorphic, so no transport
of algebra structures is needed. The theorem is stated separately so the source
and target types may inhabit different universes.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-smooth-of-localization-span-universes).
The proof combines finite presentation from the principal cover with formal
smoothness on the same cover. -/
