/-- Geometric regularity is invariant under compatible field and ring isomorphisms.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Definition 0382, transport of structure in step 5
of lem-weil-pbc-regular-through-localization.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-geometric-regularity-field-iso).

Proof: Transport Noetherianity along the ring isomorphism. For each finite purely
inseparable extension L of k', give L the k-algebra structure obtained by composing
its structure map with σ. Its dimension over k equals its dimension over k', since
σ is bijective, and pure inseparability is unchanged since the images of the two
base fields in L coincide. The rule l ⊗ a ↦ l ⊗ e(a) is balanced by the compatibility
hypothesis. The inverse rule uses e.symm and σ.symm, and gives an isomorphism
L ⊗[k] A ≃+* L ⊗[k'] B. Regularity is invariant under this ring isomorphism.
If L is in a larger universe than the one tested by IsGeometricallyRegular k A,
first replace it by Shrink L: finiteness over k makes it small in that universe.
Transport back along the canonical field isomorphism Shrink L ≃+* L. This yields
regularity after every finite purely inseparable extension of k', as required. -/
