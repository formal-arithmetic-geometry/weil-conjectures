/-- At a maximal ideal of a polynomial ring over a G-ring, there is a flat local
comparison map into a Noetherian local ring whose composite with completion is regular.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Proposition 07PV, the completion square.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-polynomial-g-ring-comparison).

Proof: Let p be the contraction of Q to R and put A = R_p. The localization
A[x] at the extension of Q is canonically R[x]_Q; the extended ideal is maximal
and contracts to the maximal ideal of A. The G-ring hypothesis makes A → Ahat
regular. The ring Ahat is Noetherian complete local. Base change A → Ahat along
A → A[x], then localize at the prime Q' of Ahat[x] lying over Q. This prime is
maximal and contracts to the maximal ideal of Ahat: modulo that ideal the
polynomial rings and Q are unchanged, since A and Ahat have the same residue
field. Set B = Ahat[x]_(Q'). The resulting map φ : R[x]_Q → B is regular,
hence flat, and is local by the contraction identity. Both rings are
Noetherian. The complete-local polynomial formal-fibre theorem makes B → Bhat
regular. The fibres of Bhat over R[x]_Q are Noetherian, being localizations of
quotients of the Noetherian completion Bhat. Composition of regular maps then
gives regularity of R[x]_Q → Bhat. This is only the bottom and right sides of
the comparison square; regularity of the completion of R[x]_Q still requires
completion of φ and faithfully-flat descent. -/
