/-- A map from a finitely presented `R`-algebra to an essentially smooth `R`-algebra factors
through a smooth `R`-algebra. Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps,
proof of Lemma Tag 07FJ,
item-eighth-resolve, lines 3062-3074
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-essentially-smooth-factors-through-smooth).

Proof:
1. By def-weil-pbc-essentially-smooth-ring-map, write `D` as `Localization S` for a
   smooth `R`-algebra `P`. For each `s ∈ S`, `Localization.Away s` is smooth by
   lem-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map-principal-localization.
2. By lem-weil-pbc-localization-colimit-principal-localizations, these principal
   localizations form a filtered diagram with colimit `Localization S`, in the sense of
   def-weil-pbc-category-colimit. The transition maps and coprojections commute with
   `P`'s structure map, hence are `R`-algebra maps.
3. Compose `g` with the presentation isomorphism of `D`. Finite presentation of `C`
   and lem-weil-pbc-finite-presentation-algebra-factors-filtered-colimit give a stage
   and a map from `C` to that stage whose composite with its coprojection is this map.
4. Take `T` to be that smooth principal localization. Compose its coprojection with
   the inverse presentation isomorphism of `D`; the two maps have composite `g`.
