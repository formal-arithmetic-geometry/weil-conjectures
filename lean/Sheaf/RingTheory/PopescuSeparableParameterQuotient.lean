/-- The quotient by positive powers of a full system of parameters can be resolved over
the corresponding quotient of the polynomial base. No minimal-singular-prime assumption
on the unreduced algebra is needed.

Source: Stacks Project, Smoothing Ring Maps, proof of Lemma 07FE, steps 9--12 of the
repaired proof (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-separable-parameter-quotient).

Proof: let `R = k[x_1,...,x_d]`, `e = 8c`, and `J = (x_i^e)`. The preimage `p` of `q`
in `R` is the origin ideal: it contains all variables, and that ideal is maximal with
quotient `k`. Localizing and then quotienting identifies the reduced local target with
`Λ_q/(π_i^e)`, and the reduced local base with `R_p/(x_i^e)`. Since the `d` images `π_i`
generate the maximal ideal of the regular local ring of dimension `d`, they are a regular
sequence. The polynomial-origin regular-local lemma and flat-over-regular lemma imply
that `R_p → Λ_q` is flat. Base change gives flatness of the reduced local map.
The maximal ideal of the reduced base is nilpotent: its power `d(e-1)+1` is zero because
every monomial of that degree is divisible by some `x_i^e`. Its residue field is `k`,
and the target reduction modulo that maximal ideal is `κ(q)`, with the original
`k`-algebra structure. Separability makes this field a filtered colimit of smooth
`k`-algebras. Nilpotent lifting therefore makes the reduced local target a filtered
colimit of smooth algebras over the reduced local base. Finite presentation factors
the map from the reduced localized `C` through a smooth algebra, giving a local resolution
whose extended singular ideal is the unit ideal.
There is only one prime in the reduced localized target, since any prime containing the
powers of the parameters contains every parameter and hence the maximal ideal. If the
reduced extended singular ideal already escapes the reduced prime, use the identity
resolution. Otherwise that prime is minimal over the ideal: localization gives a bijection
between primes below it and primes of its local ring. The height-zero delocalization lemma
then gives a resolution before localization. The quotient map and quotient prime are the
canonical ones, determined by the displayed compatibility equalities. This argument also
works for `d = 0`: both parameter ideals are zero and the local rings are fields. -/
