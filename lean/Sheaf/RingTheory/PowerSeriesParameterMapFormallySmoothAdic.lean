/-- A map between field or Cohen power-series rings carrying parameters into parameters
is adically formally smooth if its closed fibre is. No arbitrary complete local rings or
flat maps occur in this criterion: it is the coordinate lifting step of Tag 07NQ.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 07NQ, proof of (2) implies (3), last paragraphs from
"Choose elements y" through the correction psi' = psi - D'.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-power-series-parameter-map-fs-adic)

Proof:
1. For a continuous square-zero lifting problem T -> N/J over R, the quotient map
makes J a T-module because J^2 = 0. If the map kills m_T^e then m_T^e J = 0.
Filter J by J_a = {j : m_T^a j = 0}. The successive quotients are annihilated by m_T.
Descend from N/J_e to N/J_0. A lift killing m_T^b modulo a square-zero kernel kills
m_T^(2b), so every stage remains continuous. The action on the next kernel is the
original action since changing representatives by J has zero product with J.
2. Thus assume m_T J = 0, making J a vector space over the residue field K of T.
Tag 07NM gives coordinates t,y (with p omitted as a variable in the Cohen case).
Tag 07NL gives an unrestricted lift over Q or Z. In characteristic zero N is a
Q-algebra: integers are units modulo J, and a unit modulo a square-zero ideal lifts
to a unit. Keep the coefficient map and change the t-variable values to their
prescribed images from R; the variable images are nilpotent, so evaluation uses
finite truncations. The new lift agrees on all parameters of R, including p.
3. Its defect on R is a derivation into J, annihilating the parameters. The universal
property of differentials and the exact quotient differential sequence make it
factor through Omega_(k/Z), where k is the residue field of R: the R-action on J
factors through k, and the differentials of the parameters generate the conormal
image. Tensor this k-linear map with K.
4. Formal smoothness of the closed fibre gives injectivity of
Omega_(k/Z) tensor_k K -> Omega_(T/m_R T / Z) tensor_T K by Tag 07EL.
Extend the defect functional along this injection by extending a vector-space basis.
Compose with the differential of T -> T/m_R T to obtain a derivation D' on T
whose restriction to R is the defect. Subtract D' from the unrestricted lift.
Leibniz and J^2 = 0 prove multiplicativity; derivations kill 1. The correction
vanishes modulo J and cancels the defect on R, so the corrected lift is R-linear.
Apply this at every stage of the filtration in step 1. This solves all lifting problems.
Empty parameter lists and the case J = 0 require no parameter correction.
