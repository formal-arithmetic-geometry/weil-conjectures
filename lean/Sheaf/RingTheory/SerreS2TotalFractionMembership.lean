/-- A total fraction of a reduced Noetherian S2 ring lies in the ring if it does so
at every prime of height at most one, expressed by clearing a local denominator.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 031T, proof of (1) and (2), using only S2
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-serre-s2-total-fraction-membership).

Proof: Write x = a/b with b a nonzerodivisor. If x is not in R, the class of a in
M = R/bR is nonzero. Choose an associated prime p of the cyclic submodule generated
by this class; it is also an associated prime of M, and it contains the annihilator
J = (bR : a). Localizing at p gives depth(M_p) = 0. Since b is regular in R_p,
the regular-element depth formula (Tag 090R) gives depth(R_p) = 1. Condition S2
forces min(2,height(p)) ≤ 1, hence height(p) ≤ 1. The local denominator hypothesis
supplies s outside p and c with sx = c. Multiplication by b and injectivity of
R → Q(R) gives sa = bc, so s lies in J and hence in p, a contradiction.
Thus x comes from R. If b is a unit the conclusion is immediate; if R is the zero
ring every fraction already comes from R. No domain or normality assumption is used. -/
