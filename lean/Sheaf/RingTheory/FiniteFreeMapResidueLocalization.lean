/-- Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 00O0, Lemma `cokernel-flat`, parts (1) and (3),
finite-free matrix calculation (blueprint: lem-pc-finite-free-map-residue-localization).

For the injective-fibre clause, represent `u` by an `n`-by-`m` matrix. Injectivity over
`p.ResidueField` gives a nonzero `m`-by-`m` minor; its determinant `f` is outside `p`.
After localizing at `f`, elementary row and column operations put the matrix in the
block form `[I_m; 0]`. Hence the localized map is injective and its cokernel is the
free module of rank `n - m`; exactness of localization identifies this with the
displayed quotient, so it is finite and free.

For the bijective-fibre clause, the matrix is square and its determinant is outside
`p`. Localizing at that determinant makes it a unit, and the adjugate matrix gives a
two-sided inverse, so the localized map is bijective. -/
