# Finite products of normal rings

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 0CYA
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-product-normal).

Normality is the prime-localization condition of `def-weil-pbc-normal-ring`, expressed
using its Mathlib match `IsDomain`, `IsIntegrallyClosed`, and `Localization.AtPrime`.

/-- A finite product of commutative normal rings is normal.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 0CYA
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-product-normal).

Proof:
1. Given a prime ideal of the finite product, `lem-weil-pbc-product-prime-factor`
   supplies an index and a prime of that factor whose inverse image is the given prime.
   In particular the empty product has no prime ideals, so its normality is vacuous.
2. By `lem-weil-pbc-product-prime-localization`, projection onto this factor induces
   an isomorphism from the product's prime localization to the factor's prime localization.
   The latter is an integrally closed domain by the hypothesis and
   `def-weil-pbc-normal-ring` (Stacks Tags 0309 and 00GV).
3. Transport normal-domain structure across this isomorphism using
   `lem-weil-pbc-normal-domain-ring-equivalence`. Since the prime was arbitrary,
   the product satisfies `def-weil-pbc-normal-ring`. -/
