/-- A polynomial quotient that is a relative global complete intersection is flat over
its coefficient ring. Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 00SW.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-relative-global-complete-intersection-flat)

Proof:
1. For a prime `q` of the quotient, let `q'` be its inverse image in the polynomial ring.
   Part (2) of `lem-weil-pbc-relative-global-complete-intersection-partial-local-flat`,
   with `i = c` in a complete-intersection presentation, makes the localized polynomial
   quotient flat over `R`. The isomorphism of
   `lem-weil-pbc-localization-at-prime-of-quotient` identifies it with the quotient
   localized at `q`. The hypothesis applies to the displayed equations themselves.
2. It suffices to take maximal ideals `q`. Apply Mathlib's
   `Module.flat_of_isLocalized_maximal` with the quotient as both the intermediate
   algebra and the module. This version of the local flatness criterion checks each
   localization over `R` directly, so there is no need to localize `R` separately.
   Convert module flatness to ring-map flatness with `RingHom.flat_algebraMap_iff`.
   If the quotient is zero, there are no maximal ideals and the criterion is vacuous. -/
