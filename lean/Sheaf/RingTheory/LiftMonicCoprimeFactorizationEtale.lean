/-- A monic coprime factorization modulo an ideal lifts after an étale ring extension
whose canonical map on quotients is an isomorphism.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Lemma Tag 0ALH
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-lift-monic-coprime-factorization-etale).

Proof (the six steps of the DAG node):
1. Choose the degrees of the two reduced factors. If `A/I` is zero, use the degree of
`f` and zero instead. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-universal-coprime-factorization-ring` to obtain
an étale universal algebra `B`, with monic coprime factors `G,H` of the image of `f`.
This algebra is already localized at the resultant, replacing the localization of
Stacks Tag 07M0 in the original proof.
2. Its universal property gives an `A`-algebra map `B → A/I` sending `G,H` to the given
factors. It is surjective because the quotient map `A → A/I` is surjective, and factors
through `B/IB` since it kills `IB`.
3. By `lem-weil-pbc-etale-quotient-base-change`, `B/IB` is étale over `A/I`. Apply
`lem-weil-pbc-etale-section-idempotent-splitting` to its section to obtain an idempotent
`e` whose localization is `A/I`, with the given section as the localization map.
4. Lift `e` to `b` in `B` and set `A' = B_b`. Its spectrum is an open subscheme of
`Spec B` by `lem-weil-pbc-principal-localization-open-immersion`, hence étale over
`Spec A` by `lem-weil-pbc-etale-composition-cancellation`.
5. By `lem-weil-pbc-localization-quotient-commute`, `A'/IA'` is `(B/IB)_e`. The resulting
isomorphism to `A/I` is inverse to the canonical map induced by `A → A'`, as can be
checked on every element of `A`.
6. Map `G,H` to `A'`. Their images are monic and multiply to the image of `f`.
Their reductions agree with the prescribed factors under the canonical quotient map,
by the construction of the section and the isomorphism in step 5. -/
