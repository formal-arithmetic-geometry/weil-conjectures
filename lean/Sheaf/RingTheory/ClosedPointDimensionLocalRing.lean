/-- Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma 00OU (using the proof of Lemma 00OT).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-closed-point-dimension-local-ring).
The local topological dimension of the spectrum of a finitely generated algebra over a field,
at a maximal ideal, equals the Krull dimension of the localization at that ideal.

Proof:
1. A field is Noetherian (`def-weil-pbc-noetherian-ring`), hence so is its finite type algebra
   (`lem-weil-pbc-finite-type-algebra-noetherian`). Thus there are finitely many minimal primes
   (`lem-weil-pbc-noetherian-finitely-many-minimal-primes`).
2. Every open neighbourhood of the maximal ideal contains every prime below it, since the
   maximal ideal is in the closure of that prime
   (`lem-weil-pbc-spec-irreducible-closed-subsets-primes`).
3. A chain of primes below the maximal ideal gives a reversed chain of irreducible closed
   subsets in every such neighbourhood by taking closures of the points there
   (`lem-weil-pbc-irreducible-closure`, `lem-weil-pbc-spec-irreducible-closed-subsets-primes`).
   The inclusions stay strict because the corresponding prime points distinguish them.
   Taking suprema gives the lower bound by the dimension of the localization
   (`lem-weil-pbc-localization-dimension-chains-below-prime`).
4. Remove the finitely many components corresponding to minimal primes not below the maximal
   ideal. Their union is closed, so its complement is an open neighbourhood of the point.
5. Closing a chain of irreducible closed subsets of this neighbourhood in the whole spectrum
   preserves strictness. The resulting chain of primes contains a minimal prime q
   (`lem-weil-pbc-prime-contains-minimal-prime`), which must lie below the maximal ideal,
   since its component meets this neighbourhood. In the finite type domain S/q, the chain
   length is bounded by dim(S/q), which equals the dimension at its induced maximal ideal
   (`lem-weil-pbc-finite-type-domain-dimension-local-ring`). Chains below this induced ideal
   lift to chains below the original maximal ideal, bounding that local ring dimension by
   dim(S_m) (`lem-weil-pbc-localization-dimension-chains-below-prime`). This gives the upper bound.
6. The infimum defining the local topological dimension
   (`def-kun-topological-dimension-at-point`) is at least dim(S_m) by step 3, and at most it
   by the neighbourhood in steps 4 and 5. Therefore the two dimensions are equal. -/
