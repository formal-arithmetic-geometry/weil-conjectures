# Ring strict henselization

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 04GW, with the pointed-algebra description in
its proof (blueprint: def-sc-ring-strict-henselization).

The predicate specifies the colimit by an actual universal cocone, rather than choosing
its underlying ring. The large category of pointed etale algebras is essentially small:
finite presentation gives a set of representatives. No large-colimit instance is assumed.

/-- The `A`-algebra `C` is the strict henselization of the local ring `A` relative to the
chosen separable closure `K` of its residue field if it is a colimit of etale `A`-algebras
pointed in `K`. Source: Stacks Project, Tag 04GW (blueprint: def-sc-ring-strict-henselization).
An algebra map `S → K` is equivalent to a prime `q = ker(S → K)` and an embedding of
its residue field into `K` over the residue field of `A`. Morphisms commute with these
maps to `K`. The forgetful diagram retains `S` and its `A`-algebra transition maps.
`Nonempty (IsColimit c)` is the usual universal property, and the final algebra isomorphism
identifies the cocone vertex with `C`, including its structural map from `A`. -/
