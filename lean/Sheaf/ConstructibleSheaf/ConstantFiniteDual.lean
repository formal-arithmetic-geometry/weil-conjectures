/-- Constant sheafification commutes with the coefficient dual of a finite module.

Source: `WeilConjectures/ConstructibleSheaf/Monoidal.lean`,
`IsFiniteLocallyConstantSheaf.ihom_unit` docstring, finite presentation argument.

Proof: Since Λ is noetherian and M is finitely generated, choose a presentation
Λ^m → Λ^n → M → 0 with m,n finite. Exactness of constant sheafification gives the
corresponding cokernel presentation of M_X. Internal Hom into Λ_X sends this cokernel
to the kernel of the map from the dual of Λ_X^n to the dual of Λ_X^m. The dual of a
finite free constant sheaf is the corresponding finite free constant sheaf, by the
finite biproduct tensor-Hom adjunction and the unit constraint. The map between those
duals is the constant sheafification of the transposed presentation matrix: evaluation
on a basis vector gives exactly its matrix coefficients. Constant sheafification preserves
finite limits, so this kernel is the constant sheaf of the module kernel of the transpose.
Applying Hom_Λ(-,Λ) to the original presentation identifies that kernel with Hom_Λ(M,Λ).
Composing these kernel isomorphisms gives the asserted isomorphism. This also covers
M = 0, the zero coefficient ring, and the empty scheme.
