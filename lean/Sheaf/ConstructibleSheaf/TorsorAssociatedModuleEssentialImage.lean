/-- Every module sheaf made constant by the torsor is an associated sheaf.

Proof:
Transport the canonical descent datum of the pullback of F through the given
constant trivialization. The torsor isomorphism splits its double overlap into
components indexed by P. On each component the transported datum is a map of
constant module sheaves on the nonempty connected total space. The image of each
constant vector is locally constant, hence constant; evaluation recovers a
linear map of values. Its inverse is recovered from the inverse descent map.
The identity and triple-overlap cocycle give the identity and multiplication
laws of the P-action, with the left-action convention used by equivariant
sections. Transport scalars through the coefficient-ring equivalence to obtain
a ZMod ℓ representation N. Local evaluation in the trivialization identifies
sections of its associated sheaf with sections of F. The transported descent
maps make these local identifications agree on overlaps; gluing gives the
isomorphism downstairs. Sheafification in the associated functor leaves this
sheaf unchanged. This construction applies to arbitrary modules, including
zero, and to the identity torsor. -/
