# Special cocontinuous functors between sites

Source: Stacks Project, Definitions 00XJ and 03CG, Lemma 03A0, conditions (1)-(5)
(blueprint: def-weil-pbc-special-cocontinuous-functor).

Cocontinuity itself is `Functor.IsCocontinuous` for the generated topologies.
The remaining conditions use the actual covering presieves, not their saturation.

/-- Source: Stacks Project, Lemma 03A0, conditions (1)-(5), and Definition 03CG
(blueprint: def-weil-pbc-special-cocontinuous-functor).

The sites use covering presieves and their generated topologies. No strict indexed
composition class is imposed: finite coverings form a pretopology, but do not satisfy
`Precoverage.IsStableUnderComposition` for arbitrary repeated infinite index families.
The first conjunct is cocontinuity (00XJ) for the generated topologies: a covering
sieve contains a covering family, and membership in its functor pullback means
that the image arrows factor through members of that family (refinement, 00VT).
The next two conjuncts express Stacks continuity (00WV): coverings map to
coverings and pullbacks of covering arrows along arbitrary arrows are preserved.
The next two conjuncts give local equality and local lifting on a source covering.
Finally each target object has an actual covering by image objects; its index type
`Type (max uc vd)` holds every family of pairs `(U, F.obj U ⟶ V)`. Empty coverings
are allowed throughout. The categories are not required to be small, so that large
sites such as the small etale site `X.Etale` are covered (as in
`siteContinuous_pushforward_isSheaf`). As in the node, the equivalence-of-topoi
conclusion of 03A0 is not included as an additional condition. -/
