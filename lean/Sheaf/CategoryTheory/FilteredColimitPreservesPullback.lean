/-- A stage pullback preserved by every transition out of that stage is preserved
by the canonical functor to a category whose object and arrow cocones are colimits.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-filtered-colimit-preserves-pullback)

Proof: Take the chosen limiting pullback cone at stage j. To prove its image is
limiting, fix a cone in the colimit category. Joint surjectivity of the object and
arrow colimits lifts its vertex and two legs to stages. Filteredness moves those
representatives and the original stage j to a common stage. Eventual equality in
the object colimit aligns the endpoints; eventual equality in the arrow colimit
makes the cone equation hold after another transition. The composite transition
out of j preserves the original pullback by assumption. Its universal property
therefore supplies a mediating arrow at that later stage. Its image in the
colimit gives the required factorization. For uniqueness, lift two proposed
mediating arrows to a common stage above j, align their endpoints, and enforce
both factorization equations there by eventual equality. The preserved pullback
at that stage identifies the arrows, hence their colimit images agree. This
proves that the canonical functor maps the chosen limiting cone to a limiting
cone; preservation of this limit follows by uniqueness of limiting cones. No
pullbacks elsewhere in the stage categories or in the colimit are needed. -/
