/-- Homology of any page-zero complex identified with the associated graded complex.
Source: Stacks Project, Homology, Tag 012K, displayed Z and B formulas and the
page-one assertion of `lemma-spectral-sequence-filtered-complex`.
(blueprint: lem-sp-filtered-complex-graded-homology).

Proof. In degree n = p+q the differential of gr^p K is induced from K.d.
Its kernel consists of the classes represented in F^p K^n whose differential lies
in F^(p+1) K^(n+1). Its image from degree n-1 consists of classes represented by
d(F^p K^(n-1)). The quotient projection from F^p K has kernel F^(p+1) K, so these
subobjects of gr^p K are precisely complexCycles p n 1 and complexBoundaries p n 1,
respectively, including the sums with F^(p+1) in their definitions. Thus d squared
= 0 gives the required containment, and homology, the cokernel of the inclusion
of image into kernel, is the stated quotient. The isomorphisms e and their
compatibility with outgoing differentials identify the short complex at (p,q)
with that of gr^p K at n, also for its incoming differential at (p,q-1).
The induced homology isomorphism gives the assertion for P.
