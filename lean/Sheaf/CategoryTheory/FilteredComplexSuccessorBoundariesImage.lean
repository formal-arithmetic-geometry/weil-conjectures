/-- The inverse image of the incoming page boundary subobject under the successor-cycle
projection is the successor boundary subobject inside successor cycles.

(blueprint: lem-sp-filtered-complex-successor-boundaries-image).

Proof. Write n = p+q. The image of the incoming page differential consists of
classes of dx with x in F^(p-r)K^(n-1) and dx in F^pK^n. These are exactly the
classes defining B_(r+1), modulo B_r. Indeed, the incoming r-cycle condition at
filtration degree p-r is precisely that its differential lands in F^p. Use the
representative equation for D in both directions, locally lifting along the
epimorphic representative and quotient projections. The inverse image of this
incoming image under f is B_(r+1) inside Z_(r+1): the additional ambiguity B_r
already lies in B_(r+1). Both containments are
therefore equalities of subobjects. All lifts used here are pullbacks along
epimorphisms in the abelian category. -/
