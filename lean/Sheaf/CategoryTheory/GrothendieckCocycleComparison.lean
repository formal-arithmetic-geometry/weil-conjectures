/-- The fixed-degree comparison between the abstract left edge and the cocycle quotient.
The morphism c is given, and only its compatibility with the cycle inclusions is assumed.
This lemma asserts no existence of c, no filtration properties, and no collapse criterion.

Source: the Cartan--Eilenberg construction of Stacks Project, Derived Categories,
Tags 015N and 015J; the explicit cocycle calculation in step 2 of
lem-pc-grothendieck-edge-cocycle
(blueprint: lem-pc-grothendieck-cocycle-comparison).

Proof:
Choose a Cartan--Eilenberg resolution of F(I), extending I by zero in negative degrees.
Apply grothendieckSSDoubleComplexModel to its presentation with the given resolution I.
The model gives the augmentation a from GF(I) to the total complex, the abutment
isomorphisms h, and the quotient/inclusion description of the left edge. Its equation
for homologyMap a identifies h with I.isoRightDerivedObj (F composed with G) inverse.
Each term F(I^q) is G-acyclic by hFG and injectivity of I^q. Consequently the
augmentation into its resolved column becomes a quasi-isomorphism after G.
For the other filtration, the horizontal cycles, boundaries and cohomology of the
Cartan--Eilenberg resolution are injective. Their short exact sequences split, so
applying G commutes with their horizontal cohomology. The resolved cohomology row
computes R^p G(H^n(F(I))), and its degree-zero cycles identify E2^{0,n} with
G(H^n(F(I))) through the canonical rightDerivedZeroIsoSelf.
Precompose the augmentation's homology map with c followed by the homology quotient.
The inclusion condition on c says that its representative is G of the original cycle
inclusion. The quotient by the first filtration step takes the resolution-degree-zero
component; under the horizontal-cohomology identification this component is precisely
G of the quotient from cycles to H^n(F(I)). Explicitly, write U for the horizontal
degree-zero-resolution row, b: H^n(F(I)) -> H^n(U) for its induced augmentation,
and a_Z: Z^n(F(I)) -> Z^n(U) for the map on cycles. Naturality of the homology
quotient gives a_Z followed by the quotient of U equal to the quotient of F(I)
followed by b. Apply G to this equality; the split horizontal sequences identify
the quotients after G with G of these quotients. The resulting class lies in the
kernel of the next resolution differential because b is an augmentation of a
resolution. The degree-zero resolution comparison sends this class back to
G(H^n(F(I))). There are no incoming boundaries at resolution degree zero.
The stable-page inclusion into E2 preserves this representative; the transpose
sign is (-1)^(n*0)=1 on this summand. Substitute the model's left-edge and
augmentation equations.
Finally identify H^n(F(I)) with R^n F(X) by I.isoRightDerivedObj F n, giving the displayed
equality. Any two lifts c satisfying the inclusion condition agree, since iCycles is
monic, so the calculation applies to the given c, independently of the CE resolution.
