/-- Any map out of a page that kills successor boundaries kills the incoming differential.
Source: Stacks Project, Homology, Tag 012K, the displayed differential and boundary formulas.
(blueprint: new-filtered-complex-incoming-boundary-quotient).

Proof. Write pq = (p,q), n = p+q. The preceding bidegree is
(p-r,q+r-1), of total degree n-1. Pull back along epimorphisms to lift
an arbitrary source page class first to graded r-cycles and then to an
unquotiented r-cycle x in F^(p-r) K^(n-1). Such lifts cover the source:
the page projection is a cokernel, and graded r-cycles are the image of
unquotiented r-cycles under the graded projection. In the latter assertion,
the extra F^(p-r+1) summand in the definition maps to zero.
The differential dx lies in F^p K^n by the r-cycle condition. It also lies
in d(F^(p-r) K^(n-1)), so its graded class belongs to B_(r+1) at (p,q).
It lies in Z_r since d squared is zero. Lift its graded class to B_(r+1)
after another epimorphic pullback, if necessary. The equation
D.on_representatives identifies the page differential of the class of x
with the page class of dx. The hypothesis hq kills this class, by the
inclusion of B_(r+1) into Z_r. The composite in the conclusion therefore
vanishes after an epimorphic cover of the source; cancel that epimorphism.
Only finite pullbacks and image factorizations are used, so this argument
does not assume projective objects or a concrete underlying category. -/
