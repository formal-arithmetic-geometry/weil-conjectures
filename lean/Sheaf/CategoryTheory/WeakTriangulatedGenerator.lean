# Weak generators of a triangulated category

Source: Stacks Project, Derived Categories, Definition 13.36.3 (Tag 09SJ), and the
set-indexed generating-family convention (blueprint: def-pc-generators).

## Main definitions

- `CategoryTheory.IsWeakTriangulatedGenerator`: a generator detected by maps into shifts.
- `CategoryTheory.IsTriangulatedGeneratingFamily`: a family whose coproduct is a generator.
