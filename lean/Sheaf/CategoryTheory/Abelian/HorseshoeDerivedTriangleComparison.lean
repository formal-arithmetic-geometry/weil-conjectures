/-- A fixed compatible horseshoe gives a morphism from the derived image of the
single-object triangle to the derived triangle of the termwise image resolution.
Its endpoint homology maps are the canonical right-derived identifications.
No delta-functor or chosen connecting maps are involved in this statement.

Proof:
1. Extend the three resolutions and the two maps by zero to integer-indexed
complexes. Each row splits because its first term is injective. With retractions
pi and sections s the third map of the resulting distinguished triangle is
s d pi (in Lean's composition order). The cone triangle has third map minus
projection; its comparison with this split triangle fixes the sign.
2. The three augmentations are compatible quasi-isomorphisms. Transport the
triangle through them to a distinguished triangle on the single objects. Its
third map is the canonical single-triangle boundary: uniqueness follows from
Hom_D(A[0][1], C[0])=0. Compute this Hom into the bounded below injective
resolution of C in the homotopy category; every chain map vanishes by degree
bounds. Apply uniqueness of the third map of a distinguished triangle.
3. Apply the right derived functor. Its unit is an isomorphism on the bounded
below injective complexes. Naturality identifies the first two maps with the
termwise images. The shift comparison identifies the third map with the
termwise image of s d pi, since the shifted differential is -d and the functor
is additive. This is exactly the third map of the image sequence's triangle.
Together these three maps give the required triangle morphism (in fact an
isomorphism).
4. Apply homology to the endpoint maps. Compare each of the given resolutions
with the chosen resolution by a lift of the identity. Naturality of the unit,
localization's homology identification, and `extendHomologyIso` shows that its
homology map, followed by `natComplexDerivedHomologyIso`, is precisely
`homologyRightDerivedFunctorPlusObjSingleFunctorIso.hom` followed by
`isoRightDerivedObj.hom`. Comparison lifts are homotopic, so this formula is
independent of the lift. This proves both endpoint identities for every degree.
