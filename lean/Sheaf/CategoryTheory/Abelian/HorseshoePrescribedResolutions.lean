/-- Prescribed resolutions of the ends of a short exact sequence extend to a resolution
of the middle, with compatible augmentations and split short exact rows in every degree.
The rows are stated in the form used by `extMk_resolution_connecting_eq_triangle`.
Natural-number indexing represents the requirement that all three complexes vanish in
negative degrees. The isomorphisms identify the middle terms with the biproducts and the
row maps with the inclusion and projection.

Source: Stacks Project, Derived Categories, Tag 013T, proof Step 2, for objects
(blueprint: lem-sp-horseshoe-prescribed-resolutions).

Proof, Step 1: for a short exact sequence A' -> B' -> C' and embeddings u : A' -> J_A,
v : C' -> J_C into injectives, extend u through A' -> B' by injectivity
(def-sp-injective-resolutions). Together with B' -> C' -> J_C this defines an embedding
w : B' -> J_A ⊞ J_C and a commutative diagram with a split exact bottom row.
Step 2: apply the snake lemma (lem-weil-pbc-snake-lemma-abelian). Since u and v are mono,
w is mono and their cokernels form a short exact sequence, compatible with the quotient
maps and the inclusion and projection.
Step 3: start with the given augmentations. At each subsequent degree apply Steps 1 and 2
to the short exact sequence of cokernels, using the embeddings into the next prescribed
outer resolution terms supplied by exactness (def-sp-injective-resolutions). Set each
middle term to the biproduct and its differential to the quotient map followed by the
next embedding. Neither outer resolution is changed.
Step 4: the compatible quotient and embedding squares make the inclusions and projections
cochain maps and give the augmentation squares. Each differential has kernel equal to the
image of the preceding differential; in degree zero its kernel is the image of the mono
augmentation. All middle terms are injective, so this is an injective resolution
(def-sp-injective-resolutions). Each degreewise row is the split biproduct sequence. -/
