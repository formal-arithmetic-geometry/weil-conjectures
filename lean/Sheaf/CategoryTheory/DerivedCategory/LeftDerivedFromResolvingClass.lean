/-- Stacks Project, Tag 06XN (dual part) and Tag 05SE (left derived functor part)
(blueprint: lem-pur-left-derived-from-kflat-class).
An exact functor on the homotopy category has an everywhere defined exact left derived
functor if every object has a resolution in `P` and quasi-isomorphisms between objects
of `P` are sent to isomorphisms. Objects of `P` compute the left derived functor.

Proof:
1. By the resolution hypothesis, the arrows from objects of `P` to each `X` form a
cofinal subcategory of the category of quasi-isomorphisms into `X`. The second hypothesis
makes the corresponding pro-object essentially constant. For `X` in `P`, use the identity
resolution (Stacks Tag 06XN).
2. The Stacks-to-Kan bridge identifies this essential constancy with a pointwise right
Kan extension and its comparison map (`lem-pur-left-derived-defined-pointwise-kan-bridge`).
3. Assemble these pointwise extensions into a right Kan extension along `Qh`, giving the
universal pair (`lem-pur-total-left-derived-localization`).
4. Quasi-isomorphisms are saturated and compatible with the triangulation
(`lem-pur-quasi-isos-saturated-triangulated`). The everywhere-defined left derived functor
is exact by Tag 05SE (`lem-pur-left-derived-exact-when-defined`). The identity resolution
and the comparison clause of the bridge show that the counit is an isomorphism on `P`. -/
