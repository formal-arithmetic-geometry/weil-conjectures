# Shift identification for bounded below right derived functors

Source: Weil conjectures blueprint, sec-proper-base-change, sk-thm-properbasechange,
lemma lem-sp-shift-identification; Stacks Project, Tags 05SU, 015A and 05TC
(blueprint: lem-sp-shift-identification).

The three statements specify the shift comparison, its composition with the ordinary
right-derived-functor comparison in nonnegative degrees, and vanishing in negative degrees.
The shift of the single complex in degree zero is used literally, so that `X[-q]` means
`X` in degree `q`. Natural isomorphisms have domain `CochainComplex.Plus C`.

/-- The composite of the shift comparison for `RF` and cohomology of a shift is an
isomorphism natural in the bounded below complex `K`.
Source: blueprint lem-sp-shift-identification, part 1; Stacks Tag 05SU and Homology,
Definitions 011G and 011H (blueprint: lem-sp-shift-identification).

Proof: (1) Put `X = H^q(K)`. The complex `X[0][-q]` is `X` in degree `q`, with zero
elsewhere and zero differential, and is bounded below. (2) By
lem-weil-pbc-derived-direct-image-triangulated the resolution comparison gives the natural
shift isomorphism `sigma`; iterate its degree-one form, using inverses for negative shifts.
(3) By lem-sp-derived-cohomology-shift, `H^(p+q)(M[-q])` identifies naturally with `H^p(M)`.
(4) Apply cohomology to `sigma` and compose with this identification. Functors preserve
isomorphisms, and both factors are natural in `X`; precompose with `K ↦ H^q(K)`. -/

/-- In nonnegative degree, the same composite followed by the canonical comparison with
ordinary right derived functors is an isomorphism natural in `K`.
Source: blueprint lem-sp-shift-identification, part 2; Stacks Definition 015A,
Lemmas 05TH, 05TI and Proposition 05TA (blueprint: lem-sp-shift-identification).

Proof: carry out steps (1)--(4) of part 1 with `p = n`. (5) By
lem-sp-derived-functor-single-identification, an injective resolution of `X` is also a
K-injective resolution of `X[0]`. Thus `H^n(RF(X[0])) ≅ R^n F(X)`, naturally in `X`, by
computing both sides on that resolution using def-sp-left-exact-additive. Compose this
canonical isomorphism with the composite in part 1 and precompose with `K ↦ H^q(K)`. -/

/-- All three objects in the shift identification vanish when `p < 0`. The last term
spells out the convention `R^p F = 0` for negative `p`, since `Functor.rightDerived` takes
a natural-number index. A zero object is expressed by `IsZero`, rather than equality of
chosen objects.
Source: blueprint lem-sp-shift-identification, part 3; Stacks Tag 05TC (1)
(blueprint: lem-sp-shift-identification).

Proof: (6) The single complex `X[0]`, where `X = H^q(K)`, has no negative cohomology.
By lem-weil-pbc-derived-functor-negative-vanishing with lower bound zero, `H^p(RF(X[0]))`
is zero. Part 1 transports this to `H^(p+q)(RF(X[0][-q]))`; alternatively use lower bound
`q` on `X[0][-q]` and `p+q < q`. The middle term is the same cohomology object of `RF(X[0])`.
The ordinary derived functor in negative degree is zero by the stated convention. -/
