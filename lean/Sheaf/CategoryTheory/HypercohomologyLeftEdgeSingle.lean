/-- The left edge on a complex supported in a single degree is the identity, under the
canonical identifications of its cohomology with its sole term.
Source: Stacks Project, derived.tex, Tag 015J, second spectral sequence for a single complex.
(blueprint: lem-pc-hypercohomology-left-edge-single)

Proof: extend the single complex by zero. Its image in the derived category is the object
A placed in degree n. Its truncations in degrees below n are zero and those containing n
are the object itself, so both arrows defining the left edge are identities under the
canonical truncation isomorphisms. Express this object as A[0] shifted by minus n
and use shift compatibility to reduce the remaining composite to degree zero. The derived unit
on A[0], followed by the degree-zero right-derived
comparison and rightDerivedZeroIsoSelf, is the original functor applied to A, by the
normalization of the right derived unit. The extension, quotient, single-complex homology,
and shift comparisons are natural canonical isomorphisms and cancel in inverse pairs.
The degree-n cycle representative is the inverse of the single-complex term comparison;
its homology quotient is the inverse of the single-complex homology comparison. This
proves the identity displayed below, including n=0 and the zero object. -/
