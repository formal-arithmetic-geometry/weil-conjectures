/-! # Generation of a module derived category by shifts of the ring

Source: literature/stacks-project/more-algebra.tex, Remark 15.60.11 (Tag 09PB)
(blueprint: lem-pc-derived-module-free-generation).

The property in the conclusion is the semantic description of the smallest full
subcategory containing the shifts of the free rank-one module and closed under
set-indexed coproducts, distinguished triangles, and retracts.

/-- Every object of the derived category of `R`-modules is generated from the shifts
of the free rank-one module `R[0]` (`singleFunctor 0`) by coproducts indexed in the
modules' universe, distinguished triangles (third vertex), and retracts. `R` is
commutative, as rings are in the source.
Source: More on Algebra, Remark 15.60.11 (Tag 09PB),
(blueprint: lem-pc-derived-module-free-generation).

Proof:
1. Represent `K` by a cochain complex and use
   `lem-pc-derived-filtered-free-resolution` to choose a quasi-isomorphic free
   resolution with an exhaustive filtration starting at zero, termwise split
   inclusions, and successive quotients that are sums of shifts of `R`.
2. The empty coproduct puts zero in `P`. By `lem-pc-derived-module-direct-sums`,
   each quotient and every shift of it is a coproduct of the prescribed generators
   in the derived category. Use `lem-weil-pbc-complex-ses-triangle` on each
   filtration short exact sequence. Rotate the triangle to place the shifted
   quotient first, the preceding filtration term second, and the next term third.
   Induction proves `P` for every filtration term and all its shifts.
3. The telescope sequence is exact: `1 - shift` on the sum of the filtration
   terms is injective (inspect the least nonzero summand), and its cokernel is
   their union, the free resolution. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-complex-ses-triangle`.
   By `lem-pc-derived-module-direct-sums`, both telescope vertices satisfy `P`,
   so the resolution, as the third vertex, satisfies `P`.
4. The resolution is isomorphic to `K` after localization. An isomorphism makes
   `K` a retract of the resolution, so retract closure gives `P K`. -/
