/-- A finite filtration can be refined by finite filtrations of its successive quotients.
A quotient already satisfying the isomorphism-invariant property needs no refinement.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01YF (`coherent.tex`, `lemma-coherent-filter`), proof,
induced filtrations in extensions and refinement of the J-adic filtration.
(blueprint: lem-pc-s3-finite-filtration-refinement)

Proof: Use the proved source-library property P.filtrationClosure, which contains P
and zero objects and is closed under isomorphisms and extensions. First convert any
subobject chain with quotients in P.filtrationClosure into membership in this closure:
induct on the chain index, starting at the zero bottom object, and apply extension
closure to each canonical short exact cokernel sequence. Transport the last top object
to the ambient object by the underlyingIso of its identity morphism. A quotient satisfying
P belongs to the closure; one with its own P-filtration belongs to the closure by the
same index induction. Thus every quotient of the outer chain belongs to the closure,
and hence so does F.
Finally convert closure membership into the required subobject chain, by induction on
the constructors of filtrationClosure. For a zero object, subobjects are subsingleton
and the constant bottom chain of length zero works. For a monomorphism A to B with
cokernel in P, map the existing chain of A along this monomorphism and append the top
subobject of B. Map preserves bottom and order. Its consecutive cokernels are isomorphic
to those of the original chain: use the underlyingIso of the composite inclusions and
cokernel.mapIso on their commuting square. The last quotient is isomorphic to the
cokernel of A to B, again by cokernel.mapIso with the top underlyingIso. The mapped
chain ends at the subobject represented by A to B, so it is monotone through the appended
top. Transport P through these isomorphisms. Repeated subobjects and zero-length inner
chains cause no exception; no assumption that P contains zero is needed. -/
