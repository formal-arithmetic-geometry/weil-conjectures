/-- Applying an additive functor to extension by zero does not change homology
in a nonnegative degree.
Source: `HomologicalComplex.mapExtendIso` in
WeilConjectures/FromJoel/Algebra/Homology/Embedding/ExtendMap.lean and Mathlib
`HomologicalComplex.extendHomologyIso` in Embedding/ExtendHomology.lean.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-map-extend-homology)

Proof: Use the existing `HomologicalComplex.mapExtendIso` to identify E applied
to the integer extension with the integer extension of E applied to K. Additivity
supplies its required preservation of zero morphisms. Map this complex isomorphism
by degree-q homology and compose with `extendHomologyIso`.
At q=0 the incoming term of the integer complex is zero, while the natural-indexed
complex has zero incoming differential by its shape; this is exactly the boundary
case covered by `extendHomologyIso`. No exactness of E is used. -/
