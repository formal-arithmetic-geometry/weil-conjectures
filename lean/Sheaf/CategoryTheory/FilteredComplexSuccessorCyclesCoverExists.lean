/-- The successor-cycle inclusion into the page factors through its cycles.
Source: Stacks Project, Homology, Tag 012K, displayed cycle, boundary and
differential formulas preceding lemma-spectral-sequence-filtered-complex.
(blueprint: lem-sp-filtered-complex-successor-cycles-cover-exists).

Proof. Put p = pq.1, n = pq.1 + pq.2 and j = (p+r,pq.2-r+1). Let a be the
successor-cycle inclusion followed by the page quotient projection. The image
factorization defining graded successor cycles gives an epimorphism from their
unquotiented representatives onto them: adding F^(p+1) does not change this image
because the graded projection kills F^(p+1). On these representatives, dx lies in
F^(p+r+1). Regard dx as a representative in F^(p+r); its graded class is zero, so
in D.on_representatives take the target graded cycle to be zero. This gives
(a followed by D.d pq j) = 0 after the representative epimorphism, hence before
it by cancellation. The kernel universal property, HomologicalComplex.liftCycles,
now gives f with f followed by D.page.iCycles pq equal to a. No epimorphy claim
about f is needed for this factorization. -/
