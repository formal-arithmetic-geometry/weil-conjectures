# The termwise product functor on strict tower complexes

Source: Stacks Project, sites-cohomology.tex, Tag 0941, proof of
lemma-derived-limit-is-ok, the termwise product of evaluated tower complexes.
(blueprint: def-pur-tower-product-functor)

This packages the existing `roosP` and `roosPmap` as a functor, using their
existing identity and composition laws. No shift comparison is part of this definition.
