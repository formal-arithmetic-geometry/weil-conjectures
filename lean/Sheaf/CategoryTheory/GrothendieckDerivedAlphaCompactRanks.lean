/-- Every object of a Grothendieck derived category has an alpha-compact rank.

Source: Neeman, On the derived category of sheaves on a manifold, Theorem 0.2
and Section 2; Krause, On Neeman's Well Generated Triangulated Categories (2001),
page 125, Corollary of Theorem A.
(blueprint: new-sfb-derived-alpha-compact-ranks)

Proof in words: take a small perfect generating class G at rank kappa, and a
regular beta above which the canonical alpha-compact classes are extension closed.
Let S consist of objects compact at some regular rank. It contains zero and is
replete and closed under shifts by the alpha-compact API. For a distinguished
triangle, choose one regular alpha above beta and the ranks of its outer vertices;
monotonicity and canonical extension closure put its middle vertex in S.
For a v-small family in S, choose ranks for all members and a common regular alpha
above beta, the cardinality of the index, and these ranks. Its coproduct is then
alpha-compact by bounded coproduct closure. Thus S is a localizing class.
Each member of G is kappa-compact using G itself as the (G3)--(G4) witness.
Generation by G forces S to contain every object. In particular U has a regular
alpha-compact rank. This proves the union assertion without assuming it in a
new theorem or using ordinary presentability.
