# The K-injective bridge

Source: Weil conjectures blueprint, sec-abelian-varieties, sk-prop-av-pqf-finite,
def-sp-kinjective-bridge (blueprint: def-sp-kinjective-bridge).

## Main definitions

* `CochainComplex.KInjectiveResolutionChoice`: a chosen quasi-isomorphism into a K-injective
  complex in an arbitrary abelian category.
* `CochainComplex.grothendieckKInjectiveResolutionChoice`: the existing functorial resolution
  supplies such a choice for every complex in a Grothendieck abelian category.
* `CategoryTheory.Functor.rightDerivedComplexWithResolution`: `RvK := v(I)` for a chosen
  resolution of a bounded-below complex.
* `CategoryTheory.Functor.rightDerivedCohomologyWithResolution`: `R^p v(K) := H^p(v(I))`.

K-injectivity uses Mathlib's `CochainComplex.IsKInjective`, as in
`def-weil-pbc-kinjective-resolutions`: every map from an acyclic complex is null-homotopic.
The Hom-complex formulation follows by applying this in every shifted degree.
Independence of the choice and agreement with `Functor.rightDerived` on objects in degree zero
are deferred to `lem-sp-kinjective-computes`; the definitions retain the chosen resolution.

/-- A K-injective resolution consists of a complex `I`, a quasi-isomorphism `K ⟶ I`, and
K-injectivity of `I`, using the generic Mathlib notions underlying the étale specialization
`def-weil-pbc-kinjective-resolutions`.

/-- For a left exact additive functor `F` and a bounded-below complex `K`, the notation `RFK`
with a chosen K-injective resolution `r : K ⟶ I` means the complex `F(I)` obtained termwise.
Its dependence on `r` is explicit; no choice-independence claim is part of this definition.

K-injective resolution `r`, define `R^p F(K)` as `H^p(RFK)`, for every integer `p`.
Agreement with ordinary right derived functors on objects in degree zero is the later
comparison lemma `lem-sp-kinjective-computes`.
