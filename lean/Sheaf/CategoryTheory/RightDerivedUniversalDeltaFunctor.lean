/-- The right derived functors of a left exact additive functor carry connecting maps
making them a universal cohomological delta-functor, and degree zero is naturally
isomorphic to the original functor.

Source: Stacks Project, Derived Categories, Lemmas 015B (2), (4) and 05TE;
Homology, Lemma 010T (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-right-derived-universal-delta-functor).

Proof:
1. Choose injective resolutions and lift each morphism to a chain map. The sum of lifts
lifts the sum, so additivity of the functor and homology makes every right derived functor
additive (lem-weil-pbc-derived-functor-map-via-lift,
lem-weil-pbc-injective-resolution-lift-exists).
2. Left exactness identifies the degree-zero homology of the image resolution with the
original object image. Lifts respect the augmentations, so these identifications are
natural (lem-weil-pbc-left-exact-injective-resolution-degree-zero).
3. A short exact sequence, viewed as complexes concentrated in degree zero, gives a
natural distinguished triangle (lem-weil-pbc-cochain-complexes-degreewise-exact,
lem-weil-pbc-complex-ses-triangle).
4. Apply the triangulated right derived functor, using its natural shift isomorphism
(lem-weil-pbc-derived-direct-image-triangulated).
5. Take the long exact cohomology sequence and transport along the natural identification
with the right derived functors on objects (lem-sf-derived-homology-long-exact,
lem-sp-derived-functor-single-identification). These give the connecting maps.
6. The degree-zero identification and left exactness make the initial map monic.
7. Naturality of the cohomology ladder and the identifications makes the connecting maps
natural (lem-weil-pbc-derived-cohomology-ladder).
8. Additivity, exactness including the initial zero, and naturality give the required
delta-functor (def-weil-pbc-delta-functor).
9. Embed each object into an injective. Positive right derived functors vanish on it,
so the induced map effaces each positive degree
(lem-weil-pbc-derived-functor-injective-vanishing).
10. Effaceability implies universality by Homology, Lemma 010T
(lem-weil-pbc-effaceable-delta-functor-universal). -/
