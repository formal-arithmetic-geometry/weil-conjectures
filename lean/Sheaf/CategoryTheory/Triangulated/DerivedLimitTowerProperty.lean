/-- A limit cone of a represented K-injective tower has the derived-limit property.
This is the Roos comparison part of `derivedCategory_towerLimit_core`.
Source: Stacks Project, Derived Categories, Tags 0BK6, 0BK7 and 070M. Proof:
evaluation at level n has the exact left adjoint which is X through level n
and zero at higher levels. Therefore each evaluated complex is K-injective.
The theorem `termwise_product_isKInjective_and_isLimit` makes their termwise
product represent the derived-category product. The chain map one minus the
shift has the prescribed transition endomorphism after projection to each
factor. Rotate its cone triangle backwards to obtain a derived-limit triangle.
Construct the inverse-limit complex as the degreewise kernel of this chain map;
`roosComplex_quasiIso` identifies it with the shifted cone, including for
K-injective towers whose terms need not be injective or have epi transitions.
Its image under Q is an isomorphism. The uniqueness isomorphism from the supplied
limit cone to this kernel cone transports that triangle to Q(c.pt). Finally e
induces an isomorphism of the products intertwining their transition
endomorphisms. Transport the distinguished triangle along this product
isomorphism to obtain `IsDerivedLimit` for the prescribed tower.
