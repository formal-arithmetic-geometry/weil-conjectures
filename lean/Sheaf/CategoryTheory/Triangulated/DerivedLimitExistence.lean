(blueprint: lem-weil-derived-limit-existence).

## Main statements

- `exists_isDerivedLimit_and_iso`: existence and noncanonical uniqueness.
- `derivedCategory_countableProducts_and_towerLimit`: termwise products, their cohomology,
  and the inverse-limit computation for a K-injective representative of a tower.

/-- A tower with an existing product has a derived limit, unique up to isomorphism.
Source: Stacks Project, Definition 13.34.1 (Tag 08TC) and the following paragraph
(blueprint: lem-weil-derived-limit-existence).

Proof (clause 1 of the node): form `1 - s` using `def-weil-derived-limit`. TR1 and TR2
of `def-weil-triangulated-category` give its distinguished triangle, rotated backwards.
For two such triangles, rotate so the product terms come first. TR3, equivalently
`lem-weil-pbc-triangle-morphism-extension`, extends the two identity maps to a triangle map.
By `lem-sf-triangle-morphism-iso` (Tag 014A) its remaining component is an isomorphism.
TR3 supplies no unique extension, so no canonical isomorphism is asserted. -/

/-- Exact countable products pass to the derived category and commute with cohomology;
a K-injective complex of towers computes the derived limit by its termwise inverse limit.
Source: Stacks Project, Lemma 13.34.2 (Tag 07KC), Tags 0BK6, 0BK7 and 070M;
the tower computation is the general form in the blueprint
(blueprint: lem-weil-derived-limit-existence).

Proof (clauses 2 and 3 of the node):
1. Exact products applied to the short exact sequences defining cycles, boundaries and
cohomology show that cohomology and quasi-isomorphisms commute with products. Chain maps
and homotopies into a termwise product are families of maps and homotopies.
2. Use `lem-pc-quasi-isomorphisms-multiplicative-system` and
`lem-pc-left-localization-hom-colimit` in `def-weil-abstract-derived-category`: represent
component morphisms by left fractions and take the product of their denominators.
This is a quasi-isomorphism and gives existence in the product universal property.
For uniqueness, represent a map whose projections vanish by a fraction, refine each
component denominator until both the commutation and zero equations hold up to homotopy,
and take their product. Componentwise homotopies then make the original fraction zero.
This proves the product property `def-weil-category-product` for any representatives.
3. Evaluation of towers has the exact left adjoint sending `X` to the tower equal to `X`
through level `n` and zero afterwards. Thus `lem-weil-pbc-right-adjoint-preserves-kinjective`
makes each evaluated complex K-injective. By `lem-pc-ringed-space-product-kinjective`,
their termwise product is K-injective and represents the derived-category product.
4. The chain map `1 - s` represents `def-weil-derived-limit`'s transition endomorphism.
Its cone triangle, rotated backwards by TR2, makes the shifted cone a derived limit.
By `lem-weil-derived-limit-roos-complex`, the termwise inverse-limit complex is
quasi-isomorphic to that shifted cone. The representative isomorphism of towers
identifies this with the prescribed tower `(K, f)`.

`IsLimit` and `PreservesLimitsOfShape` record products with their projections, not merely
isomorphisms of objects. Limits of complexes are termwise by `HomologicalComplexLimits`.
The conclusion supplies a limit cone and its derived-limit property, without assuming
an inverse limit in advance. `e` is the compatible identification of the represented tower.
No boundedness or degreewise-injectivity assumption is imposed. -/
