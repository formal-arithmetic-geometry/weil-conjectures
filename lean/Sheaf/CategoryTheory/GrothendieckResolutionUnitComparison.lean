/-- The prescribed resolution identifies both ordinary derived homology and
composite derived homology with the complexes used to represent them. This assertion
compares the derived units and resolution isomorphisms; it involves no edge map.
Source: Stacks Project, derived.tex, Tags 015M and 015N; resolution-identification
step of lem-pc-grothendieck-hypercohomology-edge.
(blueprint: lem-pc-grothendieck-resolution-unit-comparison).

Proof:
Only an isomorphism and its two homology components are asserted here. The first
equation uniquely specifies H^n(e), and the second specifies H^n(RG(e)); these
are exactly the components used by the edge naturality argument. No object is
defined by choosing an unspecified witness.

Place I in the bounded below homotopy category by extending it by zero. Its
augmentation identifies X[0] with Q(I), since it is a quasi-isomorphism. Apply RF,
then invert the derived unit at I, which is invertible because I has injective
terms. Finally apply Q to the map/extension comparison. This constructs e.
On homology this is precisely the resolution computation of R^n F: first for the
chosen resolution by the definition of the single-object comparison, then for I
by a comparison of injective resolutions lifting the identity of X. Such
comparisons are homotopy equivalences, and homology identifies their maps with
the canonical resolution comparisons.
For the composite comparison, the uniqueness isomorphism R(GF) -> RG RF is
characterized by the equation that it carries the GF unit to the composite unit.
Evaluate that equation at I, use naturality along X[0] -> Q(I), and cancel the
invertible F unit at I. The remaining G unit is exactly the map on the right.
The homology/quotient and map/extension comparisons give the displayed source
factors. This applies in degree zero as well; there are no shifts in these
comparisons and no division by a positive degree.
