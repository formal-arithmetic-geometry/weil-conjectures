/-- The Čech nerve of any map of small-valued presheaves is acyclic in positive
cochain degrees against an injective module presheaf. No covering condition is needed.

Proof: apply the free `R`-module presheaf functor to the simplicial nerve of `f`.
At each object, split its basis by the value of `f`. A fibre with no elements
contributes zero in every nerve degree. In every nonempty fibre, prefix a chosen
lift to the tuple. The alternating deletion formula gives a contracting homotopy,
so the free module chain complex is exact in every positive degree. Exactness
of module presheaves is objectwise. All free modules are small-valued, since the
ring and both presheaves have values in the same universe. Thus injectivity of
`M` applies to the image inclusions in this complex. A cocycle factors through
the image of the outgoing boundary, and injectivity extends that factor to the
preceding chain term. Free-module adjunction followed by free-abelian adjunction
identifies these Hom groups with the terms of `presheafCechComplex f M.presheaf`;
the identifications commute with the alternating boundaries. Hence each cocycle
is a coboundary and positive cohomology is zero. -/
