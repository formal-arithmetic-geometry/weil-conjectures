(blueprint: lem-pur-kinjective-functorial-injective).
In a Grothendieck abelian category there is a functorial termwise monomorphic
quasi-isomorphism into a complex, factoring in each degree through an injective subobject.
The subobject is represented by the monomorphism `b` from the injective object `I`.

Proof:
1. By `lem-weil-pbc-grothendieck-functorial-injective-embedding`, choose functorial
   injective embeddings `i : id → I`. Set `J(M)^n = I(M^n) ⊕ I(M^(n+1))`, with
   differential `(x,y) ↦ (y,0)`. The maps `(i, i ∘ d)` define a natural termwise
   monomorphism `u : M → J(M)`. Let `v : J(M) → Q(M)` be its cokernel.
2. Take `N(M)` to be the cone of `v` shifted by `-1`. Its degree `n` term is
   `Q(M)^(n-1) ⊕ J(M)^n`, with differential matrix `[-d_Q, -v; 0, d_J]`.
   The natural map `j = (0,u)` is termwise monic, and factors through the subobject
   `0 ⊕ J(M)^n`. This subobject is injective, being a finite sum of injectives.
3. The quotient of `N(M)` by `j(M)` is the shifted cone of the identity of `Q(M)`.
   In degree `n` its terms are `Q(M)^(n-1) ⊕ Q(M)^n`, its differential is
   `[-d_Q, -1; 0, d_Q]`, and `h(q,q') = (0,-q)` contracts it: `dh + hd = id`.
   Thus it is acyclic. By `lem-weil-pbc-complex-ses-homology-long-exact`, the short
   exact sequence with this quotient makes `j` a quasi-isomorphism. All constructions
   are natural in `M`, giving the functor `N` and the natural transformation `j`. -/
