/-- The graded cohomology image is a quotient of the ambient cycles in a filtration step.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 012Q, final quotient calculation, Equation 12.24.5.2.
(blueprint: lem-sp-filtered-cohomology-image-presentation).

Proof. Set A=L^pK^n, A'=L^(p+1)K^n, Z=ker(d^n), B=im(d^(n-1)).
The inclusion of L^pK identifies its cycles with A intersection Z. Its
cohomology surjects onto the image I^p of H^n(L^pK) in H^n(K), and the
cycle projection also surjects onto I^p. The kernel of this last projection
is A intersection B: these are exactly ambient boundaries lying in A.
Likewise the image I^(p+1) is the image of A' intersection Z in H^n(K).
The composite A intersection Z onto I^p onto I^p/I^(p+1) is epic, with
kernel (A intersection B)+(A' intersection Z). Viewing this sum as a
subobject of A intersection Z by pullback, its cokernel is isomorphic to
the cokernel of I^(p+1) into I^p, which defines the graded image filtration.
The assertion needs no finiteness or bounds, and all objects are existing
cycle, image, and cokernel constructions.
