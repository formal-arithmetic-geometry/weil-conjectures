/-- Before identifying the abutment with the derived composite, the bottom edge is
homology of the augmented comparison after applying the second derived functor.
No composite acyclicity hypothesis or resolution computation for G is used here.

Source: Stacks Project, Tags 015N and 015J; the bottom interval augmentation in steps
1 and 2 of lem-sc-grothendieck-bottom-resolution-comparison.
(blueprint: lem-sc-grothendieck-bottom-augmentation)

Proof: Extend J and F(I) by zero. Precomposing the extension of phi with the
augmentation of J gives the augmentation F(X)[0] to F(I): in degree zero this
is hphi, and in every other degree the source is zero. Since the augmentation
of J is a quasi-isomorphism, its image is invertible in the derived category.
Thus its inverse followed by the comparison represents the canonical map
F(X)[0] to RF(X), transported by canonicalResolutionDerivedIso F I.
Left exactness identifies F(X) with H^0(RF(X)); RF(X) has no negative homology.
The truncation isomorphism used in grothendieckBottomEdgeSourceIso therefore
carries this canonical map to the inclusion of the interval [0,1) into the full
interval. Expand that isomorphism at q = 0: the zero shift comparisons cancel,
and the single-object homology comparison for G is the remaining source factor.
Apply RG and H^n to the inclusion and use preservation of composition. This
is precisely the displayed equality. The argument uses neither invertibility
of the G unit on F(I) nor a derived composition isomorphism. At n = 0 all the
same maps apply, with no incoming differential; zero objects and zero functors
also satisfy the equation, with both sides zero.
