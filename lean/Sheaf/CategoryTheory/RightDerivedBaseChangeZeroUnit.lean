/-- The classical degree-zero base-change map respects the augmentations from the
underived functors.

Source: Stacks Project, Derived Categories, Tag 05TD, part (3), applied to the defining
unit equation of `rightDerivedFunctorPlusBaseChange`.
(blueprint: lem-sbc-right-derived-base-change-zero-unit).

Proof:
1. Represent `Y[0]` by a nonnegative injective resolution `Y → I`. The defining equation
   `rightDerivedFunctorPlusBaseChange_fac` expresses derived base change after the
   augmentation as the levelwise transformation `e`, followed by the target augmentation.
2. Apply degree-zero homology. The comparisons in `rightDerivedBaseChange` identify
   this homology with the classical zeroth right derived functors; exactness of `β` and
   `γ` identifies their images of cycles and boundaries with cycles and boundaries of
   their image complexes.
3. In a nonnegative complex there are no degree-zero boundaries. Thus the augmentation
   on homology is the map induced from `G(Y) → G(I⁰)` into the kernel of `G(d⁰)`, which is
   precisely `G.toRightDerivedZero`; the same assertion holds for `G'` and `β(Y)`.
   Naturality of `e` with the resolution augmentation identifies the two composites.
   These are the two sides of the asserted equality. -/
