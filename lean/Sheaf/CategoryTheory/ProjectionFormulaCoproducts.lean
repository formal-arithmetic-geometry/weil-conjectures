/-- If F preserves coproducts and the tensor unit, and G satisfies the projection
formula, then G preserves coproducts.
Source: the categorical projection-formula argument; the final retract argument
is written by V3.
(blueprint: lem-projection-formula-preserves-coproducts)

Proof in words: tensoring by any object preserves coproducts because the monoidal
categories are closed. For M in C, the projection formula identifies F followed
by tensoring by M followed by G with tensoring by G(M). Consequently G preserves
the coproduct obtained by applying F and tensoring by M to a family of tensor
units. F sends the tensor unit to a tensor unit, so that family becomes a family
of copies of M, using the right unitor. Thus G preserves every copower of M.
Every family is a retract of the constant family on its coproduct, since each
summand is a retract of the coproduct using zero on all other summands.
The coproduct comparison is therefore a retract of an invertible copower
comparison, and is invertible. Empty families are included throughout. -/
