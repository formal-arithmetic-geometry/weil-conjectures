/-- The projection of successor graded cycles covers the cycles of the page differential.
Source: Stacks Project, Homology, Tag 012K, the cycle and differential formulas preceding

(blueprint: lem-sp-filtered-complex-successor-cycles-cover).

Proof. Write n = p+q. The composite from Z_(r+1) into Z_r/B_r is killed by d_r:
a representative has differential in F^(p+r+1), so its target graded class is zero.
The representative equation for D proves this after pulling back the epimorphism
from unquotiented representatives to graded cycles. Thus the composite factors
uniquely through the kernel, giving f. To see that f is epic, locally lift a page
cycle to an r-cycle representative x. Since its differential is an r-boundary in
the target graded piece, after another epimorphic pullback write dx = dy modulo
F^(p+r+1), with y in F^(p+1). Then x-y has the same source graded class and lies
in the (r+1)-cycle representatives. These local lifts show that the image of f is
the whole kernel. Pullbacks of epimorphisms remain epic in an abelian category,
so this proves the assertion without projectivity assumptions. -/
