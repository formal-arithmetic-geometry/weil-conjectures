/-- The restriction augmentation of one injective sheaf is a quasi-isomorphism.

Proof: Form the augmented complex of free abelian presheaves represented by the
iterated fibre products of the covering. Its terms are v-small-valued: each
representable has v-small Hom sets, and the tuple-index sets are v-small. After
sheafification the complex is exact. Indeed, a section of the covering sieve
locally lifts to one of the covering members. On such a localization, insert this
member at the front of each tuple to contract the augmented simplicial complex.
Exactness can be checked locally, so these local contractions prove exactness
of the sheafified augmented complex. Applying Hom into the injective sheaf is
exact. The free abelian representable adjunction identifies these Hom groups
with sections on the fibre products, and takes the simplicial boundary to the
alternating restriction differential. The sheaf condition identifies the kernel
in degree zero with sections on X by the canonical restriction map; positive
cohomology is zero by the preceding exactness argument. The categorical products
in Mathlib are the same section products through their projection universal
property. The displayed component condition fixes the augmentation to this
restriction map, so it induces precisely that degree-zero isomorphism. At all
positive degrees both homology objects are zero. If the covering index is empty,
the sheaf condition forces sections on X to be zero and every Čech term is zero,
so the conclusion still holds. No double complex or totalization is used. -/
