/-- A functor from a category with zero morphisms preserves coproducts if it preserves
sums of copies of one object, for every object.
Source: the elementary retract argument applied to the comparison morphisms.
(blueprint: lem-coproducts-of-copowers)

Proof in words: given a family K_i, put S = coproduct K_i. Each K_i is a retract
of S, using its coprojection and the map equal to the identity on that summand
and zero on the others. These retracts give a retract of the whole diagram K
into the constant S diagram. Taking sums of their images, and taking the image
of their sums, gives a retract of the comparison map for K into the comparison
map for the constant S family. The latter is invertible by copower preservation.
An arrow retract of an isomorphism is an isomorphism, so the comparison for K
is invertible. Its invertibility is the coproduct preservation property.
For an empty family the diagram retract is the identity on the empty diagram. -/
