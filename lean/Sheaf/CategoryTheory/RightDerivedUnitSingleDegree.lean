/-- The derived unit, under a normalized identification with a single-degree object,
is the ordinary coefficient comparison on cycles. This statement involves no spectral
object, truncation functor, or spectral edge.

(blueprint: lem-pc-right-derived-unit-single-degree)

Proof: The support hypothesis gives the componentwise isomorphism from L to the
single complex on L.X n, with the degree-n component the identity and the other components
the unique isomorphisms of zero objects. Its differential compatibility follows because
all differentials have a zero source or target. Transport the equation along this
isomorphism by unit naturality and homologyFunctorObjQIso naturality. Homology is fully
faithful between pure degree-n derived objects, so the displayed normalization determines
f as the canonical identification with the single complex on H^n(Q L).

Shift this single complex by n to degree zero. Naturality of the unit with respect to
shifts (NatTrans.CommShift), the single-functor shift isomorphism, and homology shift
comparison turn the resulting composite into rightDerivedPlusSingleUnitHomology followed
by singleFunctorCompRightDerivedFunctorPlusCompHomologyFunctorIso 0. The proved theorem
rightDerivedPlusSingleUnitHomology_comp_comparison identifies that composite with
G.toRightDerivedZero.app of the sole coefficient. Since G preserves finite limits,
rightDerivedZeroIsoSelf.inv is toRightDerivedZero; its composite with the hom comparison
is the identity. Transport back through the shift and quotient homology comparisons.
Finally the given equation for a determines a uniquely by the mono cycle inclusion,
so it agrees with the cycle representative in this computation. This proves the desired
equality, also for n=0 and for a zero coefficient. -/
