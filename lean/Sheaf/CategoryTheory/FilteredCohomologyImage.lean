/-- Degreewise finite filtrations induce a finite cohomology image filtration.

Proof. Take the minimum of the lower bounds in degrees n-1, n and n+1.
Antitonicity makes all three steps at this minimum top. The inclusion of this
subcomplex is an isomorphism in those three degrees; hence its map on H^n is
an isomorphism and its image is top. At the upper bound in degree n the
subcomplex has zero term, so its H^n is zero and the image is bottom. -/
