/-- A small filtered category has a single nonempty directed reindexing preserving all given
colimit cocones and all given limit cones on opposite diagrams. The functor `F` encodes the
objects `x_a` and transition maps `φ_ab`; its identity and composition laws are precisely the
system laws. Whiskering retains the given vertex and selects its legs at `F.obj a`.
Source: Stacks Project, Categories, Lemma 4.21.5 (Tag 0032), clauses (1) and (2)
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-filtered-category-directed-cofinal).

Proof:
1. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-filtered-category-exists-directed-final` to obtain a nonempty directed
   index and a final functor `F`. Its object and arrow maps give the required system, with both
   laws supplied by functoriality, independently of the target category and diagram.
2. For `F.op`, the nonemptiness condition in
   `lem-weil-pbc-initial-functor-cofiltered-criterion` is finality's first condition. For its
   equalization condition, push the finite zigzag in finality's second condition to a common
   upper bound in the directed index. Functoriality makes all resulting arrows equal.
   Apply that criterion with the target indexing category `Jᵒᵖ`: the canonical colimit map is
   an isomorphism, so the restricted cocone with the original vertex is a colimit.
3. The same `F.op` satisfies `lem-weil-pbc-initial-functor-limit`: nonemptiness is as above,
   and inserting identities at the ends of the finality zigzag gives the required orientation.
   Its clause (a) makes the restricted cone a limit, with the same index and functor.
