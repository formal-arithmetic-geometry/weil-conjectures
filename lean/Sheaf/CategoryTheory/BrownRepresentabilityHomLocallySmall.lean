/-- For an exact coproduct-preserving functor with compactly generated source,
`Hom(F(-), Y)` is representable. The Hom types may live in unrelated universes,
provided both categories are locally small in the coproduct indexing universe.
Source: Stacks Project, Derived Categories, Tag 0A8G, proof of `proposition-brown`,
and Tag 0A8F, `lemma-brown`
(blueprint: lem-pc-brown-hom-representability-locally-small).

Proof: Replace both categories by their equivalent `ShrinkHoms` models with Hom
sets in universe `w`. Transport the additive, zero, shift and triangulated structures
along the equivalences; distinguished triangles are exactly those carried to
original distinguished triangles. Equivalences preserve coproducts. For the chosen
compact generating family, the additive Hom bijections identify the canonical
maps from direct sums of Hom groups with those in the original category, so the
transported family is compact. Its coproduct remains a weak generator because
zero objects, shifts and nonzero morphisms are preserved and reflected. Transport
`F` by composing with the inverse source equivalence and target equivalence.
It is exact and preserves coproducts. Apply `brownRepresentabilityRightAdjoint`
with all three indexing/Hom universes equal to `w`. At the image of `Y`, the
resulting adjunction represents `Hom(F(-), Y)`. Transport the representing object
and its natural Hom bijections back through the equivalences. This yields a
`RepresentableBy` witness and hence the stated `IsRepresentable` instance; no
choice of adjoint on morphisms is needed in this objectwise assertion. -/
