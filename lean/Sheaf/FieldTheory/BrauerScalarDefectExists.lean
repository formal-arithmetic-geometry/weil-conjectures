/-- A splitting admits locally constant matrix lifts and an actual scalar-defect cycle.

Proof: the given splitting is determined by finitely many matrix coefficients, all
algebraic and separable over K. Enlarge their field to a finite Galois extension.
Transport the semilinear Galois action across
`e`. Skolem--Noether expresses each transported automorphism as conjugation by an
invertible matrix. Choose these lifts on the finite Galois group and inflate them to
the absolute Galois group; the resulting function `b` is locally constant. Composition
of the transported actions implies that `b g * g(b h) * (b (g * h))⁻¹` is central,
hence a unique scalar unit. Associativity is precisely the multiplicative two-cocycle
identity. Change variables to obtain the invariant homogeneous cocycle
`f(g₀,g₁,g₂) = g₀(c(g₀⁻¹*g₁,g₁⁻¹*g₂))`, written additively in the units.
All its values and matrix entries lie in a finite extension, so it is jointly
continuous into the discrete coefficient group. The compact-open exponential law for
the compact Hausdorff Galois group curries it to Mathlib's iterated continuous cochains.
The cocycle identity puts it in the cycles object, producing `z`. The construction
of the scalar defect gives the claimed identity with its evaluation at `(1,g,g*h)`.
