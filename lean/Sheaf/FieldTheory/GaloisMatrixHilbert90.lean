/-- A locally constant general-linear Galois cocycle admits an invariant matrix basis.

Proof: compactness of the absolute Galois group implies that the locally constant map
b has finite image and is constant on cosets of an open normal subgroup. The cocycle
identity implies b(1)=1. Shrink that subgroup to fix every entry of the finite image;
then b is 1 on the subgroup and descends to a cocycle with coefficients in its finite
Galois fixed field L. On L^n put T(v)=sum_g b(g)g(v). Reindexing the sum and using the
cocycle identity shows that T(v) is invariant for the semilinear action b(g)g(-).
These vectors span L^n: otherwise a nonzero row lambda annihilates all T(v). Evaluating
on v=r*e_j gives sum_g (lambda*b(g))_j*g(r)=0 for all r in L. Linear independence of
distinct field automorphisms makes every coefficient zero. The coefficient at 1 is
lambda_j since b(1)=1, contradicting lambda being nonzero. Choose a basis from these
invariant vectors and put them in the columns of t. Its columns are independent, so
t is invertible, and columnwise invariance gives b(g)g(t)=t. Embed L in the separable
closure to obtain the asserted t for every absolute Galois automorphism. When n=0,
the general linear group of the zero-dimensional space is trivial, so t=1 works.
The argument uses no division by the group order and works in every characteristic.
