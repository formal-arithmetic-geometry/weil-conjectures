/-- A locally constant matrix conjugation action descends to a central simple algebra.

Proof: on the matrix algebra put T_g(M) = b(g) * g(M) * b(g)^(-1).
The two action hypotheses give T_1 = id and T_g T_h = T_(gh). Each T_g is a
semilinear algebra automorphism by its displayed conjugation formula. Construct
A as the K-subalgebra of matrices fixed by every T_g, rather than choosing an
unspecified algebra. Local constancy on the compact Galois group gives finite
image for b. Choose an open normal subgroup N such that b is constant on its
cosets, and shrink N to fix all entries of its finitely many values. Let L be
its finite Galois fixed field. The identity hypothesis implies that b(1) commutes
with every matrix, hence is scalar. For g in N, b(g) = b(1), hence T_g is entrywise
g-action. Thus A lies in Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) L and is exactly the invariants
of the induced semilinear action of Gamma = Gal(L/K).

For any vector v in that matrix space and a in L, the sum of g(a)T_g(v) over
Gamma is invariant, by reindexing the sum. If an L-linear functional kills all
these sums, linear independence of distinct field automorphisms implies it kills
every T_g(v), hence every v. Thus invariants span over L. Select an L-basis from
these invariant vectors. An invariant linear combination has coefficients fixed
by Gamma, hence in K; the selected vectors are therefore also a K-basis of A.
The explicit multiplication map L tensor_K A to the matrix algebra is now an
algebra isomorphism. In particular A is finite dimensional. A nonzero two-sided
ideal extends to a nonzero ideal of the simple matrix algebra and so to the whole
algebra. Extension of scalars preserves dimensions, forcing the ideal to equal A.
A central element extends to a scalar matrix, and invariance forces that scalar
into K. Thus the constructed A is central simple. Nonzero n ensures nontriviality.
Extend this multiplication isomorphism to Ksep to obtain e. Invariance says
b(g) * g(e(1 tensor a)) * b(g)^(-1) = e(1 tensor a); multiplying by the inverses
gives exactly the displayed descent equation. This also handles n = 1 and
unnormalized scalar lifts, without any division by the order of Gamma.

and independence argument for finite Galois descent is expanded by an agent.
