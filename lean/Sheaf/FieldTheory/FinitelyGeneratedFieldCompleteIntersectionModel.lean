/-- A finitely generated extension with a transcendence basis of size `d` is the fraction
field of a quotient of a polynomial ring in `n` variables by a regular sequence of length
`c`, with `n - c = d`. Source: Stacks Project, proof of Tag 07BV, as used in Tag 07E1
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finitely-generated-field-complete-intersection-model).

Proof:
1. `exists_triangularFieldModel_presentation` carries out the tower-of-minimal-polynomials
   construction, clearing denominators and presenting the embedded subalgebra by the
   explicit equations `h T - 1` followed by triangular monic equations. It also proves
   that every element of `K` is a fraction of elements of this quotient.
2. `triangularFieldModelEquations_isWeaklyRegular` proves successive injectivity of
   multiplication by these equations. The quotient admits a unital map to the nonzero
   field `K`, so its defining ideal is proper. Thus the sequence is regular.
3. The explicit list has length `r + 1`; set `n = d + 1 + r` and `c = r + 1`.
4. Pull back the domain structure along the injective map. Mathlib's fraction-ring lift
   is an injective algebra homomorphism. The fraction representations prove it surjective,
   and its formula on localization constructors gives the stated algebra equivalence. -/
