/-- The fixed field in a normal extension is purely inseparable over the base.
Source: Stacks Project, Fields, Lemma 030M (2).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-normal-extension-fixed-field-purely-inseparable)

Proof:
1. For a fixed element a, normality splits its minimal polynomial over E. Every root b
is the image of a under an F-automorphism (Stacks 0BME (2)), hence b=a because a is fixed.
Conversely a is a root by algebraicity. The finite set of distinct roots is therefore {a}.
2. Mathlib identifies the separable degree of a split polynomial with the number of
its distinct roots. Thus the minimal polynomial of a has separable degree one.
3. Minimal polynomials are unchanged by the injective inclusion of the fixed field in E.
The criterion isPurelyInseparable_iff_natSepDegree_eq_one now proves pure inseparability.
This works in characteristic zero and positive characteristic, for trivial extensions and
infinite normal extensions alike; only one algebraic element is considered at a time.
