For a finitely generated separable extension of fields `L/K`, the field `L` is
the filtered colimit of its finitely generated smooth `K`-subalgebras, with
the transition maps given by inclusions.  The directed family and its union
are rendered by `Directed (· ≤ ·) A` and `∀ x, ∃ i, x ∈ A i`, respectively.
Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma 10.158.11, Tag 07BV
(blueprint: lem-kun-fg-separable-smooth). First choose a smooth `K`-subalgebra
`B` of `L` whose fraction field is `L`, using the separability hypothesis.
For each nonzero `f` in `B`, identify `B[1/f]` with the principal localization
of `B`; it remains smooth and is finitely generated over `K`. The family of
these localizations is nonempty and directed by multiplication of denominators.
Every element of `L` belongs to one of them, so their directed union is `L`.
