/-- A continuous two-cocycle admits finite, locally constant monomial coefficient data.

Proof: use the finite quotient data theorem to obtain a nonzero n, a group law
on Fin n, a locally constant quotient homomorphism q, and coefficients d with
c(g,h) = d(q(g),q(h)) and the finite twisted cocycle equation. Construct p(g)
as the permutation given by left multiplication by q(g), using the transported
group law explicitly. This is a permutation homomorphism because left
multiplication is an action and q is a homomorphism. Put w(g,j) = d(q(g),j).
The paired map (p,w) is a postcomposition of q, hence locally constant.
The finite twisted cocycle equation is exactly
w(g,p(h)j)g(w(h,j)) = d(q(g),q(h))w(gh,j).
Substitute the factorization of c to obtain the asserted coefficient equation.
No normalization is used, including for a nontrivial constant cocycle. The
construction supplies coefficients and permutations, not an algebra or matrix
splitting. All data are constructed from the given finite quotient data.
