/-- The extension over the fixed field in a normal extension is separable and normal.
Source: Stacks Project, Fields, Lemma 030M (2).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-normal-extension-fixed-field-separable-normal)

Proof:
1. The fixed elements form an intermediate field S. By the normal tower theorem
(Stacks 09HN), E/S is algebraic and normal.
2. For a in E, the roots of its nonzero minimal polynomial over F form a finite set R.
Every F-automorphism permutes R, since it fixes the polynomial's coefficients.
3. Form Q as the product of T-b for b in R, each root used exactly once. Applying an
F-automorphism to its coefficients permutes the factors, so every coefficient is fixed.
Consequently Q is a monic polynomial over S. The element a is a root of Q.
4. The minimal polynomial of a over S divides Q. Over E the factors of Q are pairwise
distinct, so Q is separable; separability descends to S and passes to its divisors
(Stacks 09H3). Hence a is separable over S.
5. This holds for every a in E, proving separability. Combined with step 1 it proves
both assertions. No finiteness of the automorphism group or of E/F is required.
