/-- The differentials of a p-independent family are linearly independent.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Tags 07P1 and 07P2, implication (1) implies (2).

Proof (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-p-independent-differentials-independent):
1. Extend the given p-independent family to a p-basis by
   `lem-weil-pbc-p-independent-extends-to-p-basis`.
2. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-p-basis-differentials-basis` to obtain a basis of
   `Ω[K⁄k]` consisting of the differentials of the extended family.
3. Given a finite linear relation among the original differentials, extend its coefficients
   by zero on the added indices. This gives a relation among the extended basis, whose
   coordinate uniqueness forces all coefficients to vanish. Thus the original
   differentials are linearly independent over `K`.
