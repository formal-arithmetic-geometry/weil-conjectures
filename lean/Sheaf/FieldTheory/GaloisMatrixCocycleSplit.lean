/-- A genuine locally constant matrix descent cocycle makes a split form split over K.

Proof: compactness of the absolute Galois group makes the locally constant map b have
finite image. Its cocycle identity forces b(1)=1. Choose an open normal subgroup N on
whose cosets b is constant, fixing every entry of its image, and fixing the finitely many
coefficients of e and its inverse in K-bases (the existence of e implies D is finite
dimensional). Then b restricts to 1 on N and descends to a cocycle of the finite Galois
extension L=S^N/K with values in GL_n(L). To prove matrix Hilbert 90 without dividing
by the group order, use T(v)=sum_g b(g)g(v). The cocycle identity makes T(v) invariant
under the semilinear action v ↦ b(g)g(v). These vectors span L^n: otherwise a nonzero
row lambda annihilates them. Applying it to v=r*e_j for every r in L gives
sum_g (lambda*b(g))_j*g(r)=0. Linear independence of distinct field automorphisms
forces every coefficient to vanish. In particular lambda*b(1)=lambda=0, a contradiction.
Choose n linearly independent vectors from this spanning set. If t has these invariant
vectors as columns, it is invertible and b(g)g(t)=t, so b(g)=t*g(t) inverse.
Conjugate e by t inverse on the
left and t on the right. The displayed descent identity then says that all images of
1 tensor d have Galois-fixed entries. The fixed elements of the separable closure are
K, so this restricts to a K-algebra map D → M_n(K). Its scalar extension is the
conjugated equivalence e, hence it is bijective by faithful scalar extension. This also
covers n=0: both sides are zero algebras whenever such e exists. No central simplicity,
Brauer class or scalar-defect hypothesis is used.
