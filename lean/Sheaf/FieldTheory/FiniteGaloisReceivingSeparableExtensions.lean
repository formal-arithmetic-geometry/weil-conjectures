/-- Finitely many finite separable extensions of a field embed into one finite Galois
extension. Source: Stacks Project, Fields, Lemmas 09GU, 09DT, 0EXM and Definition 09I0;
More on Morphisms, proof of Lemma 02LM.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-galois-receiving-separable-extensions)

Proof:
1. By `lem-weil-pbc-separable-closure-exists-galois`, choose a separable algebraic,
   separably closed extension Ω/k. Its normality makes it Galois (Definition 09I0).
2. By `lem-weil-pbc-separable-extension-embeds-separably-closed`, embed each Lᵢ into Ω
   as a k-algebra, using its separability and the separable closedness of Ω (09GU).
3. Choose finite k-bases of the Lᵢ. Their images form a finite set S in Ω. By
   `lem-weil-pbc-finite-set-in-finite-galois-subextension`, choose a finite separable
   normal intermediate field K containing S (09DT and 0EXM).
4. Each image lies in K: expand any element in its basis and use k-linearity and
   closure of K under k-linear combinations. Restrict the embeddings' codomains to K
   to obtain the required k-algebra homomorphisms. When n = 0, S is empty and K = k
   suffices, transported to the indicated universe if necessary.
