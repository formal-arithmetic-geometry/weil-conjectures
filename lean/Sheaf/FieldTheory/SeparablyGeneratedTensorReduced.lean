/-- Tensoring a reduced commutative `k`-algebra with a separably generated field extension
of `k` gives a reduced ring. Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma 10.43.6 (Tag 030U),
separably generated case (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-separably-generated-tensor-reduced).

Proof:
1. Put `E = k(s)` for the given separating transcendence basis. For each residue field
   of `S`, the source library's
   `isReduced_tensorProduct_adjoin_of_algebraicIndependent` proves reducedness after
   tensoring with `E`, by identifying it with a localization of a polynomial ring.
   `isReduced_tensorProduct_of_forall_residueField` gives reducedness of `S ⊗[k] E`.
2. A separable algebraic extension preserves reducedness: reduce the reduced algebra
   to its residue fields, and the extension to its finitely generated subalgebras using
   `IsReduced.tensorProduct_of_flat_of_forall_fg`. Each such subalgebra is a field,
   separable and of finite type, hence formally unramified. After base change to a
   residue field it is reduced by `Algebra.FormallyUnramified.isReduced_of_field`.
   This argument is proved in the private helper above.
3. Apply step 2 to `K/E` and the reduced `E`-algebra `E ⊗[k] S`. The tensor
   base-change equivalence identifies the result with `K ⊗[k] S`. Reducedness
   transports through this equivalence. -/
