Source: literature/stacks-project/algebra.tex, Section 0BR5, the denominator-clearing
argument used in Lemma 0BR8; step 1 of lem-weil-pbc-power-in-base-after-localization.

Choose finitely many A'-module generators of E. The finite purely inseparable field
extension has a uniform exponent N, by Mathlib's `hasExponent_of_finiteDimensional`.
Write each generator's q^N-th power in K' as a fraction b_i/t_i, where q = ringExpChar K'.
The compatible maps and injectivity of E into L give the equality t_i e_i^(q^N) = b_i
already in E. Let s be the product of the finitely many nonzero t_i. Each denominator
is a unit in A'[1/s], since it divides s. Map the equality in E to the tensor product
and multiply by the image of this unit's inverse to obtain the required base element.
This works also when q=1 and N=0. Empty products are 1; no normality assumption on A'
is used.

Source: literature/stacks-project/algebra.tex, Algebra, Section 0BR5
(section-universal-homeomorphism), denominator-clearing input to Lemma 0BR8
(lemma-powers) for a finite purely inseparable extension.

Proof, following the node's steps:
1. By `def-weil-finite-integral-morphism`, choose finitely many module generators
   e_i of E. The compatible fraction-field maps embed A' and E into L.
   By `def-pc-field-extension` and `def-weil-pbc-finite-purely-inseparable-extension`,
   each generator lies in K' in characteristic zero, and a common p^N-th power
   of all generators lies in K' in characteristic p. Write these elements as
   b_i/t_i, with nonzero t_i in A', and take s to be the product of the t_i.
   Localization embeds A'[1/s] in K' and E[1/s] in L; the displayed generators
   or their common powers then belong to the localized base.
2. In characteristic zero, E[1/s] is spanned by generators in A'[1/s], so the
   canonical inclusion of the base is surjective. It is injective by step 1,
   and hence this says E[1/s] = A'[1/s] as subrings of L.
3. In characteristic p, write any x as a finite A'[1/s]-linear combination of
   the e_i. Frobenius to the common power p^N distributes over this sum, and
   each summand is in the base. Thus x^(p^N) is in the base, allowing n = N.
4. Since s is nonzero and the maps are compatible, localization preserves
   the fraction fields K' and L. This establishes both characteristic clauses.
