/-- Irreducibility of the inverse image of a subset over a separably closed extension
implies irreducibility of its inverse image over every field extension.

Source: Stacks Project, Tags 054P, 020J and 038I.
Proof: for any field K over a separably closed field Ω, the spectrum map Spec K to
Spec Ω is geometrically irreducible. Indeed its field base changes are spectra of tensor
products of fields, which are irreducible by field_tensor_unique_minimalPrime. Given a
test field E over k, choose a common extension M of Ω and E over k. Form X_M as the
iterated pullback of X_E. Pullback pasting identifies its map r to X_Ω as the base change
of Spec M to Spec Ω. Thus r is geometrically irreducible and open. The inverse image under
r of the given irreducible subset of X_Ω is irreducible by isIrreducible_preimage. The
commuting projections identify it with the inverse image under X_M to X_E of the desired
subset. The latter projection is surjective, being a base change of a spectrum map between
fields. Its continuous image is therefore exactly the desired subset and is irreducible.
This proves nonemptiness as well. No closed subscheme structure is needed, and when A is
empty the hypothesis cannot hold.
