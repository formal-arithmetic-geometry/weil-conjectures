/-- Tensor pullback in a scheme base change preserves flatness over the base.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0A1H, affine reduction; Tag 051D, base change of flat modules.
Proof: since F is quasi-coherent, the affine-section condition IsFlatOver is
equivalent to relative stalk flatness (Stacks Tag 01U4). Fix a point z of X ×_S T,
with images x in X, t in T and s in S.
Choose affine neighbourhoods on which the square is described by rings A over R
and B over R. The local ring of the fibre product is a localization of A tensor_R B.
The tensor-pullback stalk is the corresponding localization of F_x tensor_R B,
with the further localizations identifying the given stalk actions. Since F_x is flat
over O_{S,s}, scalar extension gives a flat module over the corresponding localization
of B. Localization in the source ring is a filtered colimit of copies of this flat
module, hence preserves flatness over the localized base ring O_{T,t}.
The tensor-pullback stalk isomorphism transports this flatness to the recorded module.
Ordinary pullback preserves quasi-coherence. On affine opens V of T and W of the
fibre product mapping into V, its sections form a module N over the coordinate
ring of W. The stalk calculations give flatness of every localization N_q over
the corresponding localized base ring. By the affine local criterion of Tag 01U4,
N is flat over the coordinate ring of V. This is precisely the conclusion IsFlatOver.
The assertion is vacuous on an empty fibre product.
No finite presentation, proper support, or flatness of the base-change morphism is used.
Quasi-coherence is needed to recover the affine-section condition from stalks.
