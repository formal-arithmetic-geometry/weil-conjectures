/-- An immersion has finite fibres of degree at most one. Outside its image the fibre is
empty; on its image the canonical projection to the spectrum of the residue field is an
isomorphism. In particular its fibres are universally bounded.

Source: Stacks Project, Morphisms, Lemma Tag 03J9
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-immersion-fibre-degree-one).

Proof for stage 3, following the five steps of the node:
1. Base change the immersion to `Spec κ(x)`. The fibre projection is an immersion by
   `lem-weil-pbc-immersion-base-change-lft`, hence factors into a closed and an open immersion
   (`def-weil-closed-immersion`, `def-weil-open-immersion`, `def-pc-scheme-fibre`,
   `def-pc-fibre-product`).
2. The spectrum of a field has one point, so the open part has empty source or is an
   isomorphism (`def-weil-affine-spectrum`, `def-weil-open-immersion`).
3. In the latter case the closed part is the spectrum of a quotient of the residue field.
   Its ideal is zero or the whole field, giving an isomorphism or the empty scheme
   (`def-weil-closed-immersion`, `def-weil-affine-spectrum`).
4. The fibre homeomorphism onto the inverse image of `x` identifies the empty case with
   `x` outside the image (`def-pc-scheme-fibre`). Thus on the image the projection is an iso.
5. The empty scheme is affine with zero global sections; the other case has the residue
   field as its algebra of global sections. Both projections are finite, and their degrees
   are respectively zero and one (`pqf-def-affine-morphism`,
   `def-weil-finite-integral-morphism`, `def-weil-affine-spectrum`). The bound one witnesses
   universal boundedness (`def-weil-pbc-fibre-degree-bound`). -/
