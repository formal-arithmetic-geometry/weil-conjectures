/-- Generic lissity on integral affine immersions supplies one lisse locally closed
stratum in every irreducible closed subset, leaving a proper closed complement.
No partition of that complement is asserted here.

Proof: Give T its reduced induced closed scheme structure. Its underlying space is
homeomorphic to T; since T is irreducible and nonempty, this reduced scheme is integral.
It is Noetherian as a closed subscheme of X. Choose an affine open containing one point;
it is nonempty, integral and Noetherian. Compose its open immersion with the closed
immersion into X and apply the generic-lissity hypothesis. The resulting dense open W
is nonempty and is also open in the reduced induced scheme. Its image is relatively
open and dense in T. Let Z be its complement in T. Then Z is closed in X and proper
in T. The composite immersion W into X has image T minus Z. The inverse-image
composition isomorphism identifies its pullback of F with the iterated pullback supplied
by the hypothesis. Local constancy and finite geometric stalks are invariant under
isomorphism of sheaves, so that composite pullback is lisse. -/
