/-- Combine specified principal opens on which the factors of an existing reduced algebra
product are universal homeomorphisms. This is localization and tensor-product bookkeeping;
the existence of those opens, and the product decomposition, are hypotheses.

Source: smooth purity blueprint, `sk-prop-sf-cbc`, finite-algebra calculation in
`lem-weil-pbc-finite-pushforward-generic-constructible`, steps 4--9, taking a common
localization for the finitely many purely inseparable factors.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-refine-finite-domain-splitting)

Proof:
1. Put `t = prod j, s j` in `S = A[1/c]` (the empty product is one). It is nonzero since
`S` is a domain. Write it as `a / c^n` with `a` nonzero in `A`. Set `d = c * a`.
The universal properties identify `S[1/t]` with `A[1/d]`: inverting `t` inverts `a`,
and conversely; inverting the product `c*a` inverts both factors.
2. Set `A'' = A' tensor_S S[1/t]` and `E j = D j tensor_S S[1/t]` with the induced
maps. This is localization at the image of `t` in each ring. The maps from `S` into `A'`
and then into each `D j` are injective: the first is a finite etale surjective
map between domains, so its kernel vanishes by lying over and reducedness; injectivity
of the second is a hypothesis. Thus
the localized factors remain domains. Finiteness, etaleness, and surjectivity of the base
cover persist under base change. Finiteness of each factor does also.
3. Each `s j` is a unit in `S[1/t]` because it divides `t`. Therefore each new factor map
is a base change of the specified universal homeomorphism on `S[1/s j]`. Stability under
base change gives its universal-homeomorphism property, and in particular surjectivity.
4. Localize the given reduced product equivalence. Localization commutes with finite
products and with reduction: a fraction is nilpotent exactly when some denominator
multiple of its numerator is nilpotent. Tensor associativity identifies the localized
left side with the reduction of `B tensor_A A''`. Transport along the base localization
isomorphism of step 1 to obtain the asserted `A''`-algebra equivalence. For zero factors
this says that localization of the zero ring is zero. -/
