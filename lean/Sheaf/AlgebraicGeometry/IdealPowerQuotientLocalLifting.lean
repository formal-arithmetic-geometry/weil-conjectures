/-- Finite affine gluing gives eventual vanishing and lifting of sections for the
quotients by ideal-power annihilators. These are stagewise criteria, not statements
about a colimit or a choice of diagram.

Proof: On an affine open, identify F with the sheaf of M, I with a finitely generated
ideal J, and A_n with the sheaf of M_n = {x : J^n x = 0}. The specified annihilator
condition determines this identification. The cokernel is the sheaf of M/M_n.
For eventual vanishing, the denominator calculation of 01PM applied to the map
J^n -> M/M_n gives a higher power on which the map is zero, and it remains zero
after the quotient transition. Choose a finite affine cover, take the maximum of
these powers, and use sheaf uniqueness for the global map.
For lifting, represent a section on the principal opens D(f_i) of the complement
by fractions x_i/f_i^k. Clearing denominators on the overlaps yields
f_j^k x_i = f_i^k x_j after enlarging k. Put K = {x : f_i^k x = 0 for every i}.
A monomial of sufficiently large degree d has an exponent at least k; send it to
the corresponding monomial with that exponent reduced by k, multiplied by x_i.
Relations between monomials map into K, because multiplying by each f_j^k turns
the relation into the original relation times x_j. Thus this defines J^d -> M/K.
Enlarge d so K is contained in M_d, and compose with M/K -> M/M_d. It evaluates
to the section. This supplies local lifts on a finite affine cover of X.
Quasi-separatedness supplies finite affine covers of all pairwise overlaps.
Apply eventual vanishing to differences of the two local lifts after transporting
them to a common degree. Take the maximum of all cover and overlap exponents;
the local maps then agree on overlaps and glue to a global homomorphism. Its
value equals the desired section by sheaf uniqueness and injectivity of the
quotient projection on U. The empty scheme and empty complement use zero maps;
the unit ideal has zero annihilators and evaluation is ordinary sections.
