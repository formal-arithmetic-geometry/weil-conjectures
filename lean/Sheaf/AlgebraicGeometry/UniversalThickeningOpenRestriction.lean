/-- Universal first order thickenings, formal unramifiedness, and conormal sheaves
restrict to compatible open subschemes.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Morphisms, Lemma 04FA and Lemma 02HC
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-universal-thickening-open-restriction).
Proof:
1. Factor `V.ι ≫ h` through `U.ι` using
   lem-weil-pbc-morphism-factors-through-open-subscheme. Two lifts into `V` give
   two lifts into `Z`, equal by formal unramifiedness of `h`; cancel `V.ι`.
   This is lem-weil-pbc-formally-unramified-open-restriction (Stacks 02HC).
2. The first order thickening `i` is a homeomorphism on points. Its image of `V`
   is the unique open `V'` with preimage `V`. The equation `i ≫ h' = h` puts
   `h'(V')` in `U`, so factor the restricted structure map through `U`.
   By lem-weil-pbc-thickening-open-restriction, the restricted immersion `iV`
   is closed and its ideal is the restriction of `i.ker`, still of square zero.
   Cancel `U.ι` to obtain `iV ≫ hV' = hV`.
3. Given a test first order thickening over `U` mapping to `V`, compose with
   the open inclusions to get a test over `X`. Apply
   def-weil-pbc-universal-first-order-thickening to obtain the extension into `Z'`.
   Every point of the test thickening comes from its closed subscheme, so the
   extension lands in `V'`. Factor it through `V'` and cancel the open inclusions
   to check both compatibility equations over `U`.
4. Two extensions into `V'` give extensions into `Z'`, equal by universal
   uniqueness. Cancel `V'.ι` to prove their equality. Together with Steps 2-3
   this proves that `iV` is universal over `U`, as in Stacks 04F3.
5. By def-weil-pbc-conormal-sheaf-formally-unramified, the conormal modules are
   the tensor pullbacks of the square-zero ideal sheaves. Use
   lem-weil-pbc-open-immersion-module-pullback-restriction to identify restriction
   with tensor pullback, and def-pc-module-pullback for composition. The equation
   `iV ≫ V'.ι = V.ι ≫ i` and the ideal restriction from Step 2 identify the two
   modules. Independence of the chosen universal thickening follows from
   lem-weil-pbc-universal-first-order-thickening-exists. -/
