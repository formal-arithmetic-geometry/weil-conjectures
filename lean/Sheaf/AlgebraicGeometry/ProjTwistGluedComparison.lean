/-- For a fixed chart-compatible comparison, every module with the prescribed
standard generators pulls back to the corresponding Proj twist.
Source: Stacks Project, Constructions, Tags 01MN (1), 01M7 (2),(3), and
blueprint lem-sc-p1-proj-shifted-free-twist, chart and overlap steps.
(blueprint: lem-sc-p1-proj-twist-glued-comparison)

Proof: on D₊(xᵢ), the sections of the Proj twist are the degree-d fractions,
and multiplication by xᵢ^(-d) identifies them with the degree-zero ring.
This works on every subopen, so xᵢ^d trivializes the restricted twist.
For d < 0, xᵢ is invertible on this chart, so its negative powers are defined.
The equations of C identify the standard charts and their ratio coordinates.
Use the tensor-formula pullback to transport the local generator of L, and
send xᵢ^d to that generator. Tensoring with a free rank-one module over the
chart gives a free rank-one module, so the two local maps are isomorphisms.
On the overlap x₀^d = (x₀/x₁)^d x₁^d = t^(-d) x₁^d. This is exactly T.map_g₀,
so the two local maps agree after restriction. Glue these maps and their
inverses using the sheaf property. Their composites restrict to identities
on a cover, hence are identities globally. This gives the displayed iso. -/
