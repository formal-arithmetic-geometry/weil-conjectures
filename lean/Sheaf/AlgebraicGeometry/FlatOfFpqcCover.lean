/-- Flatness descends along an fpqc covering family. Source: Stacks Project, Descent,
Lemma Tag 02L2 (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-fpqc-descend-flat).

1. Flatness is invariant under isomorphisms and Zariski local on both source and target:
   the local-ring maps are identified by isomorphisms or restriction to open subschemes
   (`def-weil-flat-morphism`, `def-pc-scheme`).
2. Flatness is stable under base change (`lem-weil-pbc-flat-morphism-base-change`).
3. For a flat surjective map of affine bases, write the map as `Spec` of a ring map.
   The ring map is flat (`lem-weil-pbc-flat-ring-map-iff-flat-affine`) and its map on prime
   spectra is surjective, hence it is faithfully flat
   (`lem-weil-pbc-flat-surjective-spectrum-faithfully-flat`).
4. For each affine open `U = Spec A` of the source, its inverse image is the base change
   of `U` (`lem-weil-pbc-open-preimage-fibre-product`,
   `lem-weil-pbc-cartesian-square-pasting`). It is the spectrum of the tensor product
   (`lem-weil-pbc-fibre-product-affine-spectra`). The flat base-changed morphism therefore
   says that this tensor product is flat over the new base ring, using the affine
   equivalence and the tensor-product swap.
5. Faithfully flat descent of module flatness
   (`lem-weil-pbc-flatness-descends-faithfully-flat`) implies that `A` is flat over the
   original base ring. Thus each affine restriction of the original morphism is flat,
   and source locality implies that the original morphism is flat.
6. Steps 1, 2 and 5 verify the fpqc-local criterion
   (`lem-weil-pbc-fpqc-local-on-base-criterion`, Tag 02KP). Apply it to the given fpqc
   covering family and the flat second projections to conclude that `f` is flat. -/
