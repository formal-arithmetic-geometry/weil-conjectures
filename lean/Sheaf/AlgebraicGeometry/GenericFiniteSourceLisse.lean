/-- A constructible sheaf on a finite scheme over an integral Noetherian affine base
is lisse over some dense open of the base.
This concerns the source sheaf, not its direct image.

Source: smooth purity blueprint, `sk-prop-sf-cbc`,
`lem-weil-pbc-finite-pushforward-generic-constructible`, proof paragraphs 1--3.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-source-generic-lisse).

Proof:
1. A finite morphism is integral and closed (`pqf-lem-finite-integral-lft`), and its
source is Noetherian. Replace the source by its reduction using
`thm-weil-pbc-universal-homeomorphism-invariance`. Its irreducible components are
finite in number (`lem-weil-pbc-noetherian-finite-components`).
2. Remove the closed images of the components not dominating the integral base.
For each remaining component the points above the generic point are its generic
point: a finite algebra over the fraction field is Artinian. Use
`lem-weil-pbc-irreducible-lisse-strata` to find a lisse stratum containing that
point. A locally closed stratum containing a generic point contains an open
neighbourhood in that component. Remove the intersections with other components;
the remaining neighbourhoods are open in the source and disjoint. Their finite
union W is lisse and contains the entire generic fibre.
3. Remove the closed image of the complement of W. This image misses the generic
point, so its complement U is dense, and the restriction of E to g⁻¹(U) is lisse.
If there are no dominating components, g⁻¹(U) is empty; its unique underlying
abelian sheaf is lisse (the geometric-stalk condition is vacuous).
Transport back through reduction, which is an equivalence of etale sites.
4. The comparison in `lem-weil-pbc-etale-inverse-image-algebraic-structures`
identifies set pullback of the underlying sheaf with the underlying sheaf of
abelian pullback. Transport the trivializing cover and finite stalks through
this isomorphism to obtain exactly the displayed underlying abelian restriction. -/
