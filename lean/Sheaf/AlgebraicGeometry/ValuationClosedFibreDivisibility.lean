/-- A section vanishing on the closed fibre is divisible by an element of the maximal ideal.

Source: Stacks Project, More on Morphisms, Tag 0EX8, proof of divisibility of the
chosen section, general valuation-ring case, second paragraph.
(blueprint: lem-sc-valuation-closed-fibre-divisibility)

Proof: The residue field of Spec A at its closed point is canonically A/m. The
pullback isomorphism therefore transports the integral quotient fibre to f.fiber
(closedPoint A), and transports the adjunction-unit restriction of sections.
If A is a field, vanishing on that fibre means s = 0; take π = 0 and t = 0.
Otherwise the closed-fibre section-vanishing lemma supplies nonzero π ∈ m such
that s vanishes on X times Spec(A/(π)). Because X/A is flat and L is locally free,
multiplication by π on L is injective. Locally, its cokernel is L/πL, identified
with the pushforward of the pullback to X times Spec(A/(π)); the quotient map is
the adjunction-unit restriction. Thus s lies in the kernel on global sections.
Left exactness of global sections gives a section t with π t = s. The local
lifts are unique by injectivity, so they glue. This step does not assume that s
is a basis, and uses no fraction field or generic triviality. -/
