/-- Unit-coefficient comparison carries cup products with scalar degree-zero classes
 to scalar multiples of projection pullbacks. This is a comparison of individual cup
products, without a Kunneth or spanning assertion and without properness assumptions.

Proof: Apply the module-to-abelian comparison to the unit modules on X and Y. On the
product, first identify the external coefficient module with the unit module: tensor
pullback preserves the unit, and the tensor product of two unit modules is identified
with the unit by the unitor. Compose its induced cohomology isomorphism with the
module-to-abelian comparison to obtain eP. The comparison maps are computed on an
injective module resolution by forgetting its sections complex. Forgotten injective
modules are acyclic for abelian sections, so the acyclic-resolution comparison gives
additive equivalences. Comparison with terminal-open Ext uses the constant-sheaf
adjunction. Resolution maps lifting a structure-sheaf map compute both pullbacks, and
homotopy independence identifies these maps. Likewise the tensor map of resolutions
computes both cup products, so the coefficient identification is multiplication.
In degree zero evaluation at 1 identifies unit-module cohomology with global sections,
k-linearly. Compose with the inverse of each bijective structure ring map to get dX and
dY. If b has degree zero, its section is the scalar dY b. Pulling back this section
preserves that scalar; cup product with it is multiplication by dY b on the pulled-back
class a. Linearity moves this scalar before pullback and yields the first formula.
The degree-zero class from X gives the second formula in exactly the same manner; the
cohomological sign is 1 because one degree is zero. These arguments need neither
quasi-compactness nor separatedness, and do not assert that cup products span. -/
