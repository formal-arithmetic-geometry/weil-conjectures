/-- Derived internal Hom from a pseudo-coherent source into a bounded-below quasi-coherent
object is quasi-coherent and locally bounded below; from a perfect source into an arbitrary
quasi-coherent object it is quasi-coherent. In both cases it preserves support on a closed
subset in the second variable. Local boundedness means that each point has a neighbourhood
on which all cohomology sheaves below some integer vanish. Support means that every
cohomology sheaf restricts to zero on the open complement.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0A6H (1), (2), and Tag 0A9C, proof
(blueprint: lem-sc-rhom-supported-qcoherent).

Proof:
1. By def-pur-pseudo-coherent-complex, locally choose a bounded-above finite-free model
   of K and shrink to an affine open. By lem-pc-affine-qcoh-derived-equivalence represent
   L there by a module complex. Exactness and faithfulness of associated sheaves transfer
   its cohomological lower bound. By lem-sc-derived-internal-hom-restrict-open and
   lem-sc-affine-pseudo-coherent-rhom-qcoherent the restricted internal Hom has
   quasi-coherent cohomology vanishing below a bound.
2. A perfect K has quasi-coherent cohomology, since its local strictly perfect models have
   quasi-coherent terms. By lem-pc-perfect-rhom-tensor-comparison its dual is perfect and
   quasi-coherent, and RHom(K,L) is the derived tensor of L with that dual. By
   lem-pc-derived-pullback-tensor-qcoh this tensor has quasi-coherent cohomology.
3. If L is supported on T, its restriction to the complement is zero in the derived
   category. By lem-sc-derived-internal-hom-restrict-open the restriction of RHom(K,L)
   is RHom of the restricted objects, hence zero. Its cohomology restricts to zero.
4. Quasi-coherence is local, so the affine conclusions give quasi-coherence globally.
   The neighbourhood bounds from step 1 give exactly local boundedness, without claiming
   a uniform lower bound on a non-quasi-compact scheme. Step 3 gives support in both cases. -/
