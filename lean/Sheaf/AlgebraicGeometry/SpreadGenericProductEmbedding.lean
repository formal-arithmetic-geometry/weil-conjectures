/-- Spread the generic product map with injectivity, coordinate idempotents, and
coordinate denominator clearing. This does not construct any domain factors.

Source: smooth purity blueprint, `sk-prop-sf-cbc`, finite-algebra calculation in
`lem-weil-pbc-finite-pushforward-generic-constructible`, steps 4--9; the torsion,
idempotent and denominator arguments of `lem-weil-pbc-spread-generic-product-domains`.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-spread-generic-product-embedding)

Proof: Set C to the reduction of B tensor A0. Its generic fibre is the specified product
of fields: tensor associativity identifies the unreduced generic fibres, and localization
commutes with taking the nilradical quotient. Since A0 is finite over the Noetherian
localization S0, C is finite over a Noetherian domain. The kernel of C to its generic
fibre is therefore finitely generated torsion. Choose annihilators of its generators
and invert their product; the resulting map into the generic product is injective.
Each coordinate idempotent in that product has a numerator in C and a nonzero denominator
in A0. Invert the product of these finitely many denominators too. The resulting map
contains all the coordinate idempotents. Every field element in every coordinate is
likewise a fraction with numerator in C and nonzero denominator in A0, since the map
on the generic fibre is surjective. These fractions remain available after shrinking.
For each element of A0 inverted above, integrality over S0 and a monic equation of
least degree give a nonzero constant coefficient in its principal ideal. Clear the
coefficients' c0 denominators and invert their product together with c0 in A. Base
change of A0 to this principal open is finite etale, a domain with fraction field K',
and its spectrum map remains surjective. It is small because it is a finite module
over a ring in Type u; transport it to a finite-module presentation in Type u. The
embedding and coordinate denominator identities transport as well. The algebra maps
to L j are the compositions through K', giving the stated scalar towers. When r = 0,
the generic ring is zero and torsion killing makes C zero; both coordinate assertions
are vacuous and the map from the zero ring is injective. -/
