/-! # Termwise coefficient complex construction

This algebraic construction works for any complex; boundedness and the choice of a
representative in the derived category are handled in the presentation theorem.

/-- Termwise scalar extension and restriction give the coefficient colimit diagram.

Source: archived master `ModuleObject/Colimit/TwoColimit.lean`, Hom paragraph,
and the coefficient construction in step 3 of
`prop-weil-pbc-qbar-condensed-two-colimit`.
(blueprint: new-weil-pbc-condensed-coefficient-complex-model)

Proof: set the object at i to the termwise extension F -> H(i), restricted to E.
For each transition use the coefficient inclusion tensor the identity of C; the
coefficient inclusions compose and are E-linear. Take termwise extension to the
finite-subfield-valued condensed algebraic closure, restricted to E, for the vertex.
The coefficient ring colimit remains a colimit after the final functor H and
pullback to X. Balanced tensor is a coequalizer of action maps, so preservation
by ordinary tensor and commutation of colimits give the colimit degreewise.
The underlying E-module functor creates these colimits; complex colimits are
computed degreewise. Exactness of scalar extension and restriction identifies
localization of each termwise complex with the stated derived functor values.
Use these identifications as the comparison isomorphisms. The unit and tensor
multiplication formulas commute with coefficient inclusions: on complexes both
maps send m to 1 tensor m followed by the same inclusion. Localize this equality
of natural transformations and use the factorization equations for
leftDerivedFunctorCompIso and leftDerivedFunctorNatIso to identify the comparisons
with finiteCoefficientDerivedTensorCompIso. This gives the equation for the
canonical localized cocone arrow. No boundedness is needed: each construction is degreewise and
localization uses exact functors. Zero complexes and the empty scheme give zero
diagrams and satisfy the same formulas. -/
