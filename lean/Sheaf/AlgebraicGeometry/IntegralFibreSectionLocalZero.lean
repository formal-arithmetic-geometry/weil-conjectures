/-- A neighbourhood section whose restriction to an integral geometric fibre is
zero becomes zero on a pointed etale refinement of that neighbourhood.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0EYP, degree zero, via Tags 03Q9, 09XK, 09ZH and 0A3I.
(blueprint: lem-sbc-integral-fibre-section-local-zero).

Proof: write the integral pullback over the strict henselization Spec A as Spec B.
The section z restricts to a section z_sh there, by the inverse-image unit. With
m the maximal ideal of A, Tag 09XK makes (B,mB) henselian. The degree-zero
henselian comparison applied to the proper identity of Spec B is injective on
sections after restriction to Spec(B/mB). The residue field k of A is separably
closed; Tag 0A3I makes further restriction along k to Omega injective as well.
Composition of inverse-image units identifies the latter restriction of z_sh
with geometricFibreSectionRestriction applied to z, which is zero by hypothesis.
Therefore z_sh is zero. Tag 03Q9 identifies this equality with equality of the
germ of z and the zero germ. The filtered-colimit equality criterion gives a
pointed etale neighbourhood W mapping to the original V on which z is zero.
One can first refine V by an affine neighbourhood of its marked point; cofinality
of affine pointed neighbourhoods and the strict-henselization representative
functor ensures that the resulting W still maps to V with marked point v.
For module coefficients, forgetting to sets preserves the inverse images and
these canonical maps, and takes the module zero section to its zero section.
For an empty fibre, integrality makes the image closed, and a neighbourhood of
s disjoint from that image yields the same conclusion. -/
