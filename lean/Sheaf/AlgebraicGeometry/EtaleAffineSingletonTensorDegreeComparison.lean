/-- Affine pullback sections give canonical degree isomorphisms, with their pure-tensor
normalization, without asserting compatibility between different degrees.

Proof: write A = Γ(U,O), B = Γ(W,O), M = Γ(U,U*F). Compare tensor pullback with
Mathlib pullback using their adjunctions to the same pushforward. This transports
quasi-coherence of U*F. The product of n+1 copies of W over U is affine, and its
functions are the indexed tensor product of n+1 copies of B over A, with the
k-th projection inducing the k-th tensor inclusion. Apply the affine pullback
sections formula to this product over U. Normalize composite pullback by its
unit equation; on m tensor the pure tensor b the resulting section is the product
of the pulled-back b(k) times the restriction of m. The outer product is indexed
by functions to Fin 1, so evaluation at its unique index is an isomorphism.
Apply ULift and invert this evaluation to obtain e. Tensor generators prove the
stated normalization and also make e unique. For an empty W the section groups
and tensors are zero; for n=0 this is the ordinary affine sections formula.

/- Fixed-degree affine tensor-section calculation. The geometric proof identifies the
degree-n affine fibre product with the indexed tensor power, applies the affine pullback
sections formula, and checks the displayed normalization on pure tensors; tensor
generators then extend it to all sections. (blueprint: new-etale-affine-singleton-
