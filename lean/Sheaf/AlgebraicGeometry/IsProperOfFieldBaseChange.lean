/-- A finite type scheme over a field is proper if its base change to an extension field is
proper. Source: Stacks Project, Descent, Tag 02L1 (lemma-descending-property-proper)
(blueprint: lem-pc-proper-descends-field).

Proof:
1. The map `Spec K → Spec k` is flat, surjective and quasi-compact
   (lem-pc-field-extension-fpqc-cover).
2. The stated properness of the second pullback projection gives separatedness of `f` by
   `isSeparated_of_flat_surjective_baseChange` (lem-weil-pbc-fpqc-descend-separated).
3. Universal closedness descends for this affine pullback along a flat, surjective,
   quasi-compact map by Mathlib's `DescendsAlong` instance
   (lem-weil-pbc-universally-closed-affine-descent).
4. The locally finite type and quasi-compact hypotheses, together with separatedness and
   universal closedness, give `IsProper f` by the `IsProper` constructor. -/
