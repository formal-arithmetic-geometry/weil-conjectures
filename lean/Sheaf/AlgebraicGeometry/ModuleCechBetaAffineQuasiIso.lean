/-- The augmentation from the Cech complex of a quasi-coherent module into the total
Cech complex of an injective resolution is a quasi-isomorphism when every finite
intersection is affine. No covering hypothesis is needed for this augmentation.

(blueprint: lem-sc-module-cech-beta-affine-quasi-iso).

Proof: Restriction of an injective module to an open remains injective, so applying
sections on an intersection to the resolution computes cohomology on that open.
Quasi-coherence and affine vanishing make its positive-degree cohomology zero;
left exactness identifies its degree-zero cohomology with sections of F. Products
of these complexes over the tuples of cover indices are exact in module categories,
so each augmented column of the Cech bicomplex is a quasi-isomorphism. Filter its
mapping cone by Cech degree. In each total degree this first-quadrant filtration is
finite. Transpose the augmented bicomplex (with the standard total sign
isomorphism) so that resolution degree is the inner cohomology direction in
exists_spectralSequence. Its first page is the zero column cohomology just
calculated, so its second page and all later pages are zero. Therefore the cone
is acyclic. The resulting total augmentation is exactly moduleCechBeta:
its component in degree n is the augmentation on Cech n-cochains followed by the
(0,n) total inclusion. Hence beta induces isomorphisms in every degree. -/
