/-- An isolated point of the fibre of a locally finite type morphism gives a finite-type
ring map, quasi-finite at the corresponding prime, on every affine pair containing the
point. Source: Stacks Project, Morphisms, Tag 01TH, (2) implies (4), and Tag 01T2
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-isolated-fibre-point-quasi-finite-affine-pairs).

Proof:
1. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-lft-affine-pairs` (Tag 01T2) to obtain finite type of the
   map on sections of the affine opens.
2. By `lem-weil-pbc-affine-open-spec-points` and
   `lem-weil-pbc-affine-opens-induced-ring-map-spec-square`, the affine charts identify
   the point with its prime q and its image with the contracted prime p. By
   `lem-weil-pbc-fibre-ring-primes-bijection`, q determines a unique fibre-ring prime.
3. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-residue-field-point-naturality` to the target open immersion and
   `lem-weil-pbc-open-fibre-product` to identify the fibre of the restricted morphism
   with the open inverse image of the source open in the original fibre.
4. Use `lem-weil-pbc-spec-residue-field-identification`, residue-field naturality, and
   `lem-weil-pbc-fibre-product-affine-spectra` to identify that open fibre with the
   spectrum of the fibre ring, compatibly with the projection to the source.
5. Injectivity of the affine chart and uniqueness in the fibre-prime bijection identify
   the given fibre point with the fibre-ring prime of q. Its singleton is open in the
   original fibre, hence in this open piece, hence in the fibre-ring spectrum.
6. Together with finite type from step 1, this is precisely
   `def-weil-pbc-ring-map-quasi-finite-at-prime`.

The algebra structure is the one induced by the map on sections. The existential
finite-type witness supplies the instance needed by `Algebra.IsQuasiFiniteAtPrime`. -/
