# The reduced induced closed subscheme

Quasi-coherent ideal sheaves are represented by `Scheme.IdealSheafData`: their affine
ideals localize on basic opens. `idealOfOpens` gives their sections on arbitrary opens.

The vanishing ideal is the quasi-coherent sheaf of sections vanishing at the points of `T`.
On each affine open its ideal is the unique radical ideal with the specified zero locus;
localization on basic opens expresses equality with the associated ideal sheaf. Its closed
subscheme is reduced, has image `T`, and is unique up to a unique isomorphism over `X`.

Proof, following the nine steps of the node:
1. Evaluation is germ followed by the residue map (def-weil-residue-field); its kernels
   form ideals compatible with restriction. Pointwise vanishing is local, hence a sheaf.
2. On an affine open the closed set is the zero locus of a unique radical ideal, by
   lem-weil-pbc-affine-open-spec-points and lem-weil-pbc-zero-locus-eq-iff-radical-eq.
3. Evaluation vanishes exactly at the corresponding prime
   (lem-weil-pbc-affine-open-section-vanishing-prime), so the ideal is the intersection
   of those primes, hence the radical ideal of step 2.
4. On a basic open the same condition gives the localization of this ideal
   (lem-weil-pbc-basic-open-function and lem-weil-pbc-affine-open-section-vanishing-prime).
5. The ideal sheaf and the associated module agree on the basis of basic opens, hence
   agree as subsheaves; thus the ideal sheaf is quasi-coherent (pqf-def-coherent,
   lem-weil-pbc-spec-tilde-free-module, lem-weil-pbc-spec-module-tilde-sections and
   lem-weil-pbc-affine-tilde-gamma-adjunction).
6. The quasi-coherent ideal cuts out a closed immersion, locally the quotient spectrum,
   whose image is the given zero locus (lem-weil-pbc-quasi-coherent-ideal-closed-subscheme).
7. Quotients by radical ideals are reduced; reducedness is affine-local
   (lem-weil-pbc-affine-scheme-reduced-iff and def-pc-reduced-scheme).
8. For another reduced closed immersion, its affine kernel ideals are radical with the
   same zero loci, hence equal. Equality on the affine basis gives equality of ideal sheaves
   (def-sbc-closed-immersion-ideal-sheaf and lem-weil-pbc-zero-locus-eq-iff-radical-eq).
9. Equal ideal sheaves give a unique isomorphism over the ambient scheme
   (lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersions-equal-ideal-isomorphic). -/
