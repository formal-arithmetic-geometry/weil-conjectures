/-- The image of a closed subset proper over the base under a universally closed
morphism over that base is closed and proper over the base.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0CYQ, part (2).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-closed-subset-proper-over-base-universally-closed-image)

Proof:
1. Universal closedness makes `f(Z)` closed. Give `Z` and `Z' = f(Z)` their reduced
   induced closed subscheme structures using
   `lem-weil-pbc-reduced-induced-closed-subscheme`. Form `Z'' = X ×[Y] Z'`
   (`def-pc-fibre-product`); the reduced source factors through it by
   `lem-weil-pbc-reduced-source-factors-through-closed-subscheme` (Tag 0356).
2. The projection `Z'' → Z'` is universally closed by
   `lem-weil-pbc-universally-closed-base-change`. The map `Z → Z''` is a closed
   immersion by `lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersion-cancellation`, using
   `lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersion-base-change` for `Z'' → X`. Composition
   (`lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersion-integral-separated-uc`) makes `Z → Z'`
   universally closed; it is surjective by its underlying image.
3. Properness of `Z → S` supplies separatedness. Descend it along the surjective
   universally closed map using `lem-weil-pbc-surjective-universally-closed-separated`.
4. The closed immersion `Z' → Y` and the locally finite type map `Y → S` give
   local finite type for `Z' → S` by `lem-weil-pbc-proper-fp-permanence`.
5. Descend universal closedness of `Z → S` along `Z → Z'` by
   `lem-weil-pbc-image-universally-closed` (Tag 03GN). Together with separatedness
   and local finite type this proves properness of `Z' → S`. -/
