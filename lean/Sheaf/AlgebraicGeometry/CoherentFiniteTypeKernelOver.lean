/-- A map from a finite type module on an open slice to the restriction of a coherent
module has a finite type kernel.
Source: Stacks Project, Modules, Lemma 01BY (2), with Definition 01BV.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-coherent-finite-type-kernel-over).

Proof: Opens of the slice over U are exactly the opens of X contained in U. Restrict
local finite generating families for G to these opens. The relation condition for G
applies to every such open, so G restricted to U is coherent. For each point of U,
choose a finite free epimorphism onto F on a neighborhood. The kernel L of its
composite into G is finite type by the relation condition. Each section of the
kernel of φ lifts locally through this epimorphism, and its lift lies in L. Thus L
maps epimorphically onto the kernel of φ. Images of finite type modules are finite
type, so these local kernels are finite type; the neighborhoods cover U. This is
the proof of coherent_finiteType_submodule_kernel (2) on the open slice, with no
assumption on the behavior of F at the boundary of U. -/
