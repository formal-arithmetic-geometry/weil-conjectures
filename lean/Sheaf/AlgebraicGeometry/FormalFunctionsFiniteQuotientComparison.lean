/-- The finite quotient system on the local base change is identified with the
infinitesimal fibre cohomology system. The theorem records only the finite-level
part of the geometric dictionary and leaves the stalk comparison separate.

Proof: Write A = O_y and let i'_n : X_n → X' be induced by the factorization
Spec(A/m^(n+1)) → Spec A → Y. Pasting pullback squares identifies X_n with the
quotient base change of X'. Its immersion ideal is J^(n+1), by compatibility of
extended ideals with powers. Composition of tensor pullbacks identifies F_n with
i'_n^*F'. The closed-immersion unit is epi with kernel J^(n+1)F', so it induces an
isomorphism from formalModuleQuotient J (n+1) F' to i'_{n*}F_n. Apply H^p and the
affine cohomology edge isomorphism 089W to get b_n. The action of the completed local
ring, when restricted along algebraMap A, agrees with the quotient action of A
because evaluation of algebraMap is Ideal.Quotient.mk. Thus b_n has exactly the
specified scalar action. For adjacent levels the two sheaf maps to i'_{n*}F_n agree
after precomposition with the epimorphic larger quotient projection: both are the
unit for the composite immersion. Cancel this epi and apply h-map functoriality.
This proves naturality on adjacent transitions and hence all arrows of the inverse
sequence, yielding b. Define r_n by the cohomology pullback along i'_n. Its A-linearity
follows from the same scalar identity, and factorization of the unit through the
quotient gives r_n = b_n H^p(q_n). For any linear a with the local germ formula,
apply r_n to that formula for a representative xi on V. Composition of pullbacks
identifies the resulting class with pullback along X_n → f^{-1}V. Restriction to its
inverse-image open yields precisely IsFormalFunctionsTheta for (r_n).comp a.
Resolution independence ensures that this holds for every I, K and comparison choice
in that predicate. This argument never requires r_n to be surjective, so it includes
p=0, F=0 and an empty fibre. It uses no comparison with a completed module or limit. -/
