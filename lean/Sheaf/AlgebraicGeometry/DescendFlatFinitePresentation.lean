/-- Flatness of a locally finitely presented morphism over a quasi-compact quasi-separated
stage descends from a directed inverse limit with affine transitions to some later stage.
The source and target at the original stage are also quasi-compact and quasi-separated.

Source: Stacks Project, Limits of Schemes, Tag 04AI in Situation 081D
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-descend-flat-finite-presentation).

Proof:
1. Cover X₀ by finitely many affine opens U_b mapping into affine opens V_b of Y₀,
   themselves mapping into affine opens W_b of S₀. Use quasi-compactness of X₀,
   lem-weil-pbc-affine-open-spec-points and lem-weil-pbc-morphism-into-affine-scheme.
   Local finite presentation makes each ring map B₀ᵇ → C₀ᵇ finitely presented by
   lem-weil-pbc-lfp-affine-opens-finite-presentation.
2. On the upper tail, inverse images of W_b are affine since transitions are affine
   (pqf-def-affine-morphism). Their rings form a directed system with colimit Aᵇ.
   lem-weil-pbc-limit-affine-transition and lem-weil-pbc-spec-colimit-limit identify
   the inverse image in the limit with Spec Aᵇ, compatibly with its projection.
3. lem-weil-pbc-open-fibre-product and lem-weil-pbc-fibre-product-affine-spectra identify
   the base-changed U_b and V_b with spectra of the corresponding tensor products.
   The restricted morphism is Spec of id ⊗ (B₀ᵇ → C₀ᵇ), by the universal property
   of the fibre product (def-pc-fibre-product).
4. Flatness of the morphism over the limit gives flatness of these restricted morphisms:
   open subschemes have the ambient local rings (def-pc-scheme, def-weil-flat-morphism).
   lem-weil-pbc-flat-ring-map-iff-flat-affine makes the tensor-product ring maps flat.
5. lem-weil-pbc-colimit-flat-ring-map supplies a stage above which each such ring map
   is flat, using its finite presentation and flatness over the colimit.
6. Directedness gives a common upper bound for the finitely many stages and the original
   index. The base-changed U_b cover the source there. Their restricted morphisms are flat
   by lem-weil-pbc-flat-ring-map-iff-flat-affine; their local rings are the ambient ones,
   so def-weil-flat-morphism gives flatness of the whole morphism at that stage. -/
