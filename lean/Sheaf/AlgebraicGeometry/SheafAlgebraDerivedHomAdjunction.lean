/-- The explicit algebra-valued derived Hom is right adjoint to derived restriction
of scalars. No finiteness, Noetherianity, cohomological bound, or assertion about
quasi-coherence of the output is involved.

Proof:
1. Restriction along B.hom has right adjoint sheafAlgebraHom Y B. On an open U,
   an O-linear map from the restricted M to F determines the B-linear map to
   Hom(B,F) by m ↦ (b ↦ φ(bm)); evaluation at 1 is its inverse. These formulas
   commute with restriction and postcomposition and give the sheaf adjunction.
2. Restriction of scalars is exact: its finite-limit and finite-colimit properties
   are sheafAlgebraRestrictScalars_preservesFiniteLimits and
   sheafAlgebraRestrictScalars_preservesFiniteColimits. Consequently its derived
   functor is its termwise localization mapDerivedCategory.
3. Compute the right derived Hom on the fixed functorial K-injective resolution
   sheafAlgebraHomResolution. The underived right adjoint sends K-injectives to
   K-injectives because its exact left adjoint preserves acyclic complexes.
   Thus the derived adjunction exists and its right functor is the localization
   of Hom(B,I(-)). The comparison derivedRHomAlgebraModule_comparison identifies
   this with the explicitly constructed derivedRHomAlgebraModule, including the
   B-action, since both use sheafAlgebraHom and the same resolution.
4. Localization uniqueness and the exact-functor comparison with
   rightDerivedFunctor transport the adjunction to the stated left functor.
   Evaluation at one and multiplication still give inverse maps when B is zero,
   when Y is empty, and for unbounded complexes; the K-injective argument applies
   in all these cases. -/
