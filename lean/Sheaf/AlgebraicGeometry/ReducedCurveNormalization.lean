/-- A reduced finite-type curve admits a finite list of its distinct integral components.
Source: Stacks Project, Varieties 0BXR; Morphisms 035P; Properties 0BA8.

Proof: A finite-type scheme over a field is Noetherian, so its irreducible components form
a finite set. Enumerate this set without repetitions by Fin n, including n = 0 in the
empty case. Give each component its reduced induced closed subscheme structure. It is
integral, since its underlying space is nonempty and irreducible and its structure is
reduced. Its inclusion is a closed immersion and its image is the chosen component.
A chain of irreducible closed subsets of this closed subspace is also such a chain in X,
so its dimension is at most that of X. The enumeration gives injectivity and exhaustivity.

/-- Assemble finite smooth modifications of the distinct integral components.
Source: Stacks Project, Varieties 0BXR and Morphisms 0BAJ, 01WK, 0CYI, as used in
Etale Cohomology 0A3Q.

Proof: Take the finite disjoint union of the Y i and use the maps ν i followed by ι i
on its summands. Closed immersions and ν i are finite, so their composites and their
finite coproduct are finite. Smoothness is local on the source, and each summand is
smooth over k. Each irreducible chain of the coproduct lies in one open-and-closed
summand, so its dimension is at most one. For each component remove every other
component, then intersect with its dense open U i. These intersections are disjoint
opens in X, each containing the generic point of its component, and their union is
dense. The closed immersion of that component is surjective over its intersection;
as X is reduced its ideal is zero, so it is an isomorphism there. All other summands
have empty preimage, and ν i is an isomorphism there by restriction from U i. These
local inverses glue over the union. For n = 0 use the empty coproduct and empty open.

/-- A reduced separated finite-type scheme of dimension at most one over an algebraically
closed field admits a finite modification from a smooth separated finite-type scheme of
dimension at most one, which is an isomorphism over a dense open.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 0BXR, 0B8Y and the proof of 0A3Q.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-reduced-curve-normalization)

Proof:
1. Enumerate the irreducible components and put their reduced closed subscheme structures
on them. The proved helper `exists_integral_component_cover_of_reduced_curve` supplies
this cover from Noetherianity, vanishing ideals, and the dimension bound for subspaces.
2. Normalize each integral component. The proved helper `integral_curve_modification`
uses the source library's finite normalization, dimension preservation and dense-open
isomorphism results. Normality and dimension at most one give regularity; regularity
then gives smoothness over the perfect field k. This works in dimension zero as well.
3. Choose these modifications simultaneously. The proved helper
`exists_modification_of_component_modifications` takes their coproduct, whose map is
finite and whose structure map is smooth. The open summands bound its dimension by one.
The remaining dense-open gluing is `lem-weil-pbc-dense-open-component-modifications`.
4. Finiteness over X gives separatedness and finite type over k by composition, and
these properties together with the coproduct's dense open give the stated witness. -/
