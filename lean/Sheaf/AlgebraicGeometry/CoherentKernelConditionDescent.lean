/-- A single kernel on an open `W` is finite type if the finite-type kernel condition
holds for the restrictions of the target module to the members of an open cover.
No finite-type hypothesis on the target module is required.
Source: Stacks Project, Modules, Definitions 01BV (definition-coherent), 01B5
(definition-finite-type), and Section 01AF (section-kernels).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-coherent-kernel-condition-descent).

Proof: Intersect `W` with each member `U i` of the cover. These intersections cover
`W`, including when the index type is empty and `X` is empty. On each intersection,
restrict the map `f`. Restriction preserves the structure module and finite direct
sums, so its source identifies with the free module of rank `n`. Transitivity of
restriction identifies its target with the restriction of `F|_(U i)` to that
intersection. The local hypothesis therefore makes the kernel of this map finite
type. Kernels are computed sectionwise, so restriction of `kernel f` is isomorphic
to this kernel; finite type is invariant under isomorphism. For any point of `W`,
choose a cover member containing it, then the neighbourhood with finite generators
for this local kernel. This neighbourhood is open in `W` and generates the original
kernel there by transitivity of restriction. Hence `kernel f` is of finite type.
There is no surjectivity requirement on `f`, and rank zero is included. -/
