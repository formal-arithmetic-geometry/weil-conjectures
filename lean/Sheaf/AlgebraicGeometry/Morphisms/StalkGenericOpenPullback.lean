/-- Over the stalk trait at a minimal point outside U, the generic fibre is exactly C_U.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0EYJ, local reduction and trait paragraphs.
(blueprint: lem-sbc-stalk-generic-open-pullback)

Proof: The image of Spec O_{S,s} in S consists of generalizations of s. By minimality,
all of these except s lie in U. A discrete valuation ring has precisely its zero and
maximal primes. The maximal prime maps to s, and the zero prime maps to the generic
point of S, with residue field the function field of S. Hence Spec k(S) identifies
with the inverse image of U in Spec O_{S,s}, including its scheme structure: a
uniformizer cuts out the closed point, and localization at it is the fraction field.
Pulling this square back along c proves that L_K is the inverse image of C_U in L.
The specified map k lands in C_U and commutes with the projections by hk.
The open immersion C_U into C is a monomorphism, so this factorization agrees with
the canonical one, and the displayed square is cartesian. The argument also applies
when C or its generic fibre is empty. -/
