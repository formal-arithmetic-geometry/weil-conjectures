/-- Any morphism between the generic restrictions of finite étale covers of a
normal integral scheme extends uniquely over that scheme.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0BQM, full faithfulness of generic-point restriction.
(blueprint: lem-sbc-normal-integral-generic-hom-full)

Proof: Cover B by affine opens Spec A. A is an integrally closed domain and
its fraction field is B's function field. Finite étale A-algebras are normal
and equal the integral closure of A in their generic algebras, componentwise.
The given generic algebra homomorphism carries elements integral over A to
elements integral over A; it therefore restricts to an A-algebra homomorphism
between these integral closures, in the contravariant direction. This gives
a morphism on each affine open. The finite étale algebras are torsion free
over A, so these extensions agree on overlaps whenever their generic
restrictions agree. They glue to f over B. The given cartesian squares identify
its generic restriction with fη and yield the compatibility equation.
Uniqueness follows from the same torsion-freeness on each affine chart.
Empty covers and disconnected finite étale algebras are included; the
integral-closure argument applies to their finite products, including zero. -/
