/-- Normalized diagonal conormal derivations agree on sections of every open.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 08S2.
(blueprint: lem-sc-diagonal-conormal-affine-sections-unique).
Proof: let W be the intersection of the two inverse images of U under the
projections. Its diagonal inverse image is U since both composites with the
diagonal are the identity. Pull a back under each projection on W and subtract.
Pulling this difference along the diagonal gives zero by functoriality. The
sectionwise description of a sheaf-module kernel therefore supplies a section s
of the actual kernel with this difference as its image. Apply the normalization
of each derivation to the same W and s. Both values equal the restriction to U of
the same tensor-pullback unit applied to s, so they agree. This works also for the
empty open and for a nonseparated morphism; W need not be affine. -/
