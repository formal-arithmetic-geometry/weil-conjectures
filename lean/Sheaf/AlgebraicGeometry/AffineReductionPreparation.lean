/-- Reduction produces an integral affine base and a reduced affine source, before shrinking.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0559, second proof, first paragraph; Tags 01IZ and 054M.
Proof: let S be the reduction of V and take q to be its canonical map. The named
reduction theorem makes q a surjective closed immersion and S reduced. Lift η through
q. Specialization reflects along q and the open inclusion of V, so the lift is generic.
Thus S is irreducible, hence integral. The reduction of an affine scheme is affine.
Since the image of f is in V, the pullback of f to V is isomorphic to X. Pullback
pasting identifies P = X ×_T S with the pullback of this affine scheme along q;
thus P is affine. Take Z to be the reduction of P and h its canonical map.
The same reduction theorem makes Z reduced and h a surjective closed immersion,
so Z is affine and h is a universal homeomorphism. The composite from Z to S is
locally of finite type: the projection from P is a base change of f and the reduction
map h is a closed immersion. No flatness or finite presentation is asserted here.
The empty source is allowed; the generic point ensures a nonempty integral base.
