/-- Sums from two explicit splittings agree after restriction along a commuting square.
No finiteness assumption on `f` is needed: the two finite splittings are supplied.

Proof. Pull the two clopen coproducts back along `g₁` and `g₂`. Their pieces still form
finite clopen coproducts of the common pullback `Z ×[X] Y`, and their projections to `Z`
are isomorphisms. The pullback universal property identifies the transported sections,
so functoriality of `F` and additivity of its restriction maps identify each restricted
sum with the sum on the pulled-back splitting, applied to the same restricted input
(the inputs agree because `g₁ ≫ h₁ = g₂ ≫ h₂`).

To compare these splittings, intersect every piece of the first with every piece of the
second. Through either piece's isomorphism to `Z` these intersections give clopen subsets
of `Z`. For a point of `Z`, each sheet of one splitting meets exactly one sheet of the
other, defining a bijection of the index sets. Since both index sets are finite, intersect
these finitely many clopen subsets to get a neighbourhood on which this bijection is
constant. These neighbourhoods cover `Z`. On each, corresponding sheet sections factor
through the same intersection piece, and both invert its projection to the neighbourhood;
thus they coincide. Reindex the finite sum by that bijection. Separatedness of `F` gives
the asserted equality on `Z`.

If the index sets have different cardinalities, no point of `Z` can exist, by the
bijection just constructed. The empty-cover sheaf condition makes `F(Z)` the zero group,
so equality still holds. The same argument handles either or both index sets empty.
This is solely compatibility of already explicit local sums; it constructs no global
section and asserts no covering or gluing theorem. -/
