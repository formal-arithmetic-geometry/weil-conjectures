/-- The sheaf coproduct of lower-truncated higher images is a coproduct on affine sections.
This assertion concerns only the family of higher-image sheaves; no ambient derived
coproduct or its higher direct image occurs in its statement.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 08D5, bounded-below paragraph, and Tag 015J; Tag 01I7
(blueprint: lem-pc-truncated-higher-images-affine-coproduct).

Proof.
1. Canonical lower truncation preserves quasi-coherent cohomology: the cohomology is
   unchanged in degrees at least a and zero below a. It has common lower bound a.
2. For each i, apply bounded-below truncation hypercohomology for direct image. Its
   second page is R^p f_* H^r. On an affine target open the preimage is qcqs. Ordinary
   higher images of quasi-coherent modules are quasi-coherent: affine acyclicity and
   localization of sections give localization of cohomology in the affine case;
   Mayer--Vietoris on a finite affine cover, with quasi-compact overlaps supplied by
   quasi-separatedness, gives it for the preimage. These comparisons commute with
   principal restriction. The higher-image presheaf description therefore gives
   the affine localization criterion for quasi-coherence of the second-page sheaves.
3. Closure under kernels and cokernels/images gives quasi-coherence of all later
   pages. In total degree q the convergent filtration is finite, and its graded
   pieces are stable terms of these pages. Descending extension induction from its
   zero last step makes the abutment quasi-coherent. Below the bound a it is zero.
4. Arbitrary sheaf coproducts of quasi-coherent modules are quasi-coherent. Apply
   affine evaluation of quasi-coherent colimits to their canonical coproduct cocone.
   This gives the displayed module colimit, including an empty index type and the
   empty affine open. No claim that arbitrary module-sheaf coproducts are sectionwise
   is needed.
