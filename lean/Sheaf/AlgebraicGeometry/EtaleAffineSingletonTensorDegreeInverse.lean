Compare tensor pullback with Mathlib pullback by uniqueness of the left
adjoint to the same pushforward, respecting their units. This transports
quasi-coherence of U*F from the Mathlib pullback theorem.

Proof: apply the affine pullback sections formula to P → U and U*F;
quasi-coherence of U*F follows from that of F. The affine ring comparison
and the unit-normalized composition isomorphism turn it into a bijective
additive comparison c. Lift it and invert singleton product evaluation.
Its pure-tensor formula agrees with the assumed formula of f. To prove
f = c, evaluate at the unique product index and use ordinary tensor
induction followed by indexed tensor induction. Scalar multiples of pure
indexed tensors move to the coefficient factor by the balanced relation,
so the assumed equations determine the maps on additive generators.
Thus f is bijective; its inverse additive homomorphism gives inv. The two
inverse equations hold on elements and hence as categorical morphisms.
For n=0 this is the affine sections formula; for empty W both groups vanish.
