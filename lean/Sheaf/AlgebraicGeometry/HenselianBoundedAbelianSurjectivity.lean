/-- Henselian restriction is surjective for abelian sheaves killed by one positive
integer. This supplies only the bounded, abelian, surjective part of comparison;
it is independent of the general-coefficient effacement theorem in Gabber.lean.

Source: Stacks Project, Tags 09ZE (finite-coefficient effacement), 09ZH (degree zero)
and 09ZI (the long-exact-sequence induction).

Proof: Regard G as a sheaf of modules over the finite ring Z/n. To prove comparison
in all degrees for these sheaves, first use 09ZE within Z/n-module sheaves. Here
03SA(3), inverse-image preservation of colimits and 03Q5 represent a closed-fibre
class by a constructible Z/n-module sheaf C mapping to G. Apply 09Z7(3) to embed
C in a finite sum of finite pushforwards of finite constant Z/n-modules. Finite
base change 0959 and finite-pushforward cohomology 03QP identify each summand's
class with one on the closed fibre of its finite cover. Tag 09ZD supplies a finite
surjective cover killing that finite constant class. Push forward the unit along
that cover. It is monic by surjectivity on geometric points, and the edge/unit
compatibility identifies its cohomological effect with the pullback just killed.
Take the finite sum of these monomorphisms and compose with the embedding of C.
Push out along C → G. This yields a monomorphism G → G' killing the original
class; G' and its cokernel remain Z/n-module sheaves. All maps here are Z/n-linear.
The same construction with the closed subscheme equal to the whole affine scheme
kills classes on X. Induct on q, simultaneously proving bijectivity for every
Z/n-module sheaf. In degree zero, henselian Stein connectedness gives the
nonempty connected closed-fibre intersections for every finite cover; apply the
abelian global-sections criterion and the degree-zero cohomology comparison.
For injectivity in degree q, efface
a source class, express it as a boundary from the cokernel, and use bijectivity
in degree q-1 and exactness to show that a class with zero restriction was zero.
For surjectivity, efface a closed-fibre class, express it as a boundary from the
cokernel on the fibre, lift that class by degree q-1 surjectivity, and take its
boundary on X. Naturality of the long exact sequence gives the required image.
Finally retain just surjectivity and forget the finite-ring module structure.
Neither the general Λ-module effacement nor the comparison declaration in
Gabber.lean is used. Lift Z/n to the coefficient universe when realizing the
argument in ModuleCat. The cases n = 1, q = 0 and empty spectra are included. -/
