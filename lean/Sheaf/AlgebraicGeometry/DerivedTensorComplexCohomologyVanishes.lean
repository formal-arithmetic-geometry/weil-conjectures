/-- Vanishing of `H^i(E ⊗ᴸ L)` for two objects of `D(𝒪_X)`: choose a K-flat representative
`K` of `E` and a complex `N` representing `L`, and require the degree `i` cohomology of
`Tot(K ⊗ N)` to be zero. Representatives must exist, so this predicate is not vacuous.
K-flat replacement (Tag 06YS), essential surjectivity of `Q`, and independence of
representatives (Tag 06YU) identify this with derived tensor cohomology vanishing.
It extends `schemeDerivedTensorCohomologyVanishes`, whose second argument is a module
placed in degree zero; it does not replace that existing predicate.
