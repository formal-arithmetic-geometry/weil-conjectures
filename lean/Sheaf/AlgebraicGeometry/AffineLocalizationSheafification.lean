/-- Sheafification preserves affine values when restrictions to principal opens
are localizations. No sheaf condition is assumed on non-affine opens.

Source: Stacks Project, Tags 01HV and 009H (sheaves on a basis).
(blueprint: lem-pc-affine-localization-sheafification).

Proof: fix an affine W = Spec A and set N = P(W). The localization hypotheses
identify P(D(a)) with N[1/a] by the canonical numerator map. Uniqueness of maps
out of localized modules makes these identifications compatible with further
principal restrictions, including intersections D(a) ∩ D(b) = D(ab). They are
also linear for the localized structure rings. Thus on the principal-open
basis of W, P agrees with the associated-module sheaf tilde N. This is a sheaf
on the basis; arbitrary covers reduce to finite covers because principal opens
are quasi-compact, and the finite-cover equalizer is the module localization
sheaf condition. Extension from the basis is unique. Sheafification restricted
to W is this extension, and its unit agrees with the canonical identification
on every basis member. At W = D(1) that map is an isomorphism. Empty opens cause
no exception: localization at zero forces the module on the empty open to be
zero. No values of P on non-affine opens are used. -/
