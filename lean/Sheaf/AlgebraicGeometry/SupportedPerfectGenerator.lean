/-! # Perfect generators with support

Source: Stacks Project, Derived Categories of Schemes, Lemma 36.15.4 (Tag 0A9A)
(blueprint: lem-pc-supported-perfect-generator).

Support on `T` is the stalkwise form of the landed support statements: every cohomology
sheaf has zero stalk at every point outside `T`. `D_QCoh,T(O_X)` is the full subcategory
of `D(O_X)` on objects with quasi-coherent cohomology supported on `T`. The weak generator
condition (`def-pc-generators`) is expressed by the shifted-Hom vanishing criterion, as in
`AlgebraicGeometry.perfect_generator_pullback`; Hom groups and shifts of the full
subcategory are those of the ambient derived category.

/-- The full subcategory of quasi-coherent derived objects supported on a closed subset
with quasi-compact complement is triangulated and has a single perfect weak generator
supported on that subset.
Source: Stacks Project, Lemma 36.15.4 (Tag 0A9A).
(blueprint: lem-pc-supported-perfect-generator).

Proof:
1. If X is affine, its quasi-compact open complement of T is a finite union of principal
opens D(fᵢ). The Koszul complex on the fᵢ is perfect and supported on T, since each fᵢ acts
null-homotopically. Koszul orthogonality (lem-pc-perfect-generation-koszul-orthogonal)
identifies an object orthogonal to its shifts with the derived pushforward of its zero
restriction to the complement. Thus it generates the supported category.
2. Induct on a finite affine open cover. Write X = U ∪ V, with V affine and U the union
of the earlier members. Quasi-separatedness ensures U and its complement of T satisfy
the hypotheses. Choose a perfect supported generator P on U by induction.
3. Use lem-sc-perfect-support-map-lift with the zero map P → 0 to lift P to a summand
of Q|U, with Q perfect on X and supported on T.
4. Put Z = X minus U. The complement of Z ∩ T in V is quasi-compact. The affine
Koszul construction gives K supported on Z ∩ T. By lem-pc-supported-open-pushforward,
K' = R(V → X)₊K is perfect and equals extension by zero. Q ⊕ K' is perfect and supported.
5. If E is orthogonal to every shift of Q ⊕ K', open restriction adjunction gives
orthogonality to K on V. Koszul orthogonality identifies E|V with pushforward from
W = V minus (Z ∩ T). Supported-open pushforward identifies E|W with pushforward from
U ∩ V. Derived direct-image composition and open restriction base change show that
the unit E → R(U → X)₊(E|U) is an isomorphism on U and V, hence globally.
6. Adjunction gives Hom(Q[n], E) = Hom(Q|U[n], E|U), containing Hom(P[n], E|U) as a
summand. The latter groups vanish, so E|U = 0 by induction and E = 0 by step 5.
The weak-generator definition now yields the generator Q ⊕ K'.
7. Zero, shifts and extensions preserve quasi-coherence and support. For extensions,
use the long exact cohomology sequence and exact open restriction. Thus the full
subcategory inherits its triangulated structure from the ambient derived category. -/
