/-- Extension along the local ring map of a scheme morphism reflects invertibility
of a map between finite locally free stalks.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 00O0, Lemma 10.79.4(3), finite free matrix argument.
(blueprint: lem-sc-finite-locally-free-stalk-base-change-reflects-iso)

Proof: Choose finite free frames for M and N near h(t), so their stalks are free
of finite ranks m and n over R = O_{W,h(t)}. Put S = O_{T,t}. Reducing the given
isomorphism over S modulo its maximal ideal gives an isomorphism over k(t).
The local map R to S induces a field extension k(h(t)) to k(t). A matrix over a
field is injective or surjective if and only if its scalar extension to a larger
field is, as can be checked by ranks or Gaussian elimination. Thus m = n and
the determinant of the original matrix is nonzero modulo the maximal ideal of R.
An element of a local ring with nonzero residue is a unit. The adjugate divided
by this unit is a two-sided inverse of the stalk matrix. Transporting back along
the chosen frames gives the stated stalk isomorphism. For m = n = 0 the map
between zero modules is invertible; for unequal ranks the premise is impossible.
No flatness of R to S is used. -/
