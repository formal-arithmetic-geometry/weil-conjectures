/-- The explicit external tensor map on ordinary sections is bijective.
Source: Stacks Project, Varieties, Tag 0BED, equation-kunneth-on-cech.
(blueprint: lem-sc-external-global-sections-tensor-bijective).

Proof: Choose finite affine covers of X and Y, using quasi-compactness. Their
pairwise intersections are affine by the affine diagonal criterion. On each
U_i times V_j and each overlap the affine product, pullback and tensor section
formulas identify the external section map with the tensor of the corresponding
section modules; the formulas on pure tensors make these comparisons commute
with restrictions. First hold V_j fixed and apply the sheaf equalizer for the
cover of X. Tensor over k is exact and preserves finite products, so its kernel
is Gamma(X,F) tensor G(V_j). These identifications commute with restriction in
V_j. Apply the sheaf equalizer for the cover of Y, now tensoring with Gamma(X,F).
The resulting isomorphism is the displayed explicit linear map because this
holds on pure tensors on every chart. Tensor induction gives equality on all
elements. If either scheme is empty or either coefficient is zero, its section
module and the external section module are zero, and the same equalizers apply.
No positive-degree acyclicity or cohomology comparison is used. -/
