/-- A morphism locally of finite type and quasi-finite at a point has an isolated
point in its scheme-theoretic fibre (Stacks Project, Lemma 01TH).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-quasi-finite-at-point-isolated)

Proof (Stacks 01TH, (1) implies (2), with the node's affine identifications):
1. Unpack `IsQuasiFiniteAtPoint` (`pqf-def-quasifinite`, Stacks 01TD) to obtain affine
   opens `U = Spec A` containing `x` and `V = Spec R` containing its image, with
   `f(U) ⊆ V`. The finite-type ring map is quasi-finite at the prime corresponding
   to `x`; by `def-weil-pbc-ring-map-quasi-finite-at-prime`, the corresponding prime
   of the fibre ring is an open singleton.
2. The residue field of `V` at `s = f x` is that of `S`, compatibly with its canonical
   point map (`lem-weil-pbc-residue-field-point-naturality`). Consequently the fibre
   of `U → V` embeds as the open subset `p⁻¹(U)` of `X_s`, compatibly with the first
   projection (`lem-weil-pbc-open-fibre-product`).
3. Identify this fibre with the spectrum of `A ⊗[R] κ(p)` using
   `lem-weil-pbc-spec-residue-field-identification` and
   `lem-weil-pbc-fibre-product-affine-spectra`. Uniqueness of fibre products
   (`def-pc-fibre-product`) gives a homeomorphism onto `p⁻¹(U)` respecting projections.
4. The homeomorphism `fiberHomeo` (`def-pc-scheme-fibre`) supplies the unique point
   `ξ = f.asFiber x` over `x`. It lies in `p⁻¹(U)` and corresponds to the fibre prime from step 1
   by `lem-weil-pbc-fibre-ring-primes-bijection`. Its singleton is therefore open
   in `p⁻¹(U)`, hence in `X_s` since `p⁻¹(U)` is open.
5. Transport the singleton through `fiberHomeo` to the point `⟨x, rfl⟩` in the
   subspace `f⁻¹({s})`. This gives the second, equivalent, openness statement.

The point `ξ` is Mathlib's `f.asFiber x = (f.fiberHomeo (f x)).symm ⟨x, rfl⟩`, the unique
point of the fibre over `x` (`fiberι_asFiber`); isolation is spelled as in the landed
consumers (`IsOpen ({f.asFiber x} : Set (f.fiber (f x)))`, STATE line QUASI-FINITE).
