/-- A canonical derived-to-ordinary pullback comparison at a quasi-coherent module
flat over its own scheme is invertible. The affine-local IsFlatOver predicate at the
identity expresses intrinsic flatness, independently of any family morphism.

Source: Stacks Project, Tags 06YD and 06YJ;
`lem-pc-flat-complex-derived-pullback`, Steps 1--2.
(blueprint: lem-pc-flat-module-canonical-derived-pullback).

Proof: On an affine open, intrinsic flatness says that the section module is flat
over the coordinate ring. Localizing proves stalkwise flatness, which for a
quasi-coherent sheaf is equivalent to exactness of tensoring with it. Thus G[0] is a
bounded-above termwise flat complex (the other terms are zero). Apply
flatComplexDerivedPullback to compute its derived pullback by termwise tensor
pullback. Identify the functor F in that theorem with tensorPullback using its
specified equalities on objects and maps. The resulting counit is invertible at
G[0]. Any other left-derived counit for the same functor differs by the unique
invertible comparison supplied by the left-derived universal property, so its
component there is also invertible. Unpack IsDerivedModulePullbackComparison:
c is precisely that component followed by the localization of the single-complex
pullback isomorphism. Both factors are invertible, so c is invertible. This applies
to arbitrary a, including maps with empty domain and the zero module. -/
