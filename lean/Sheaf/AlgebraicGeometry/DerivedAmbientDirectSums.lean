/-- Termwise direct sums of any representatives give direct sums in `D(𝒪_X)`, and their
cohomology is canonically the direct sum of the cohomology sheaves.
Source: Stacks Project, Lemma 07D9 (1)-(2), and proof of Lemma 08DT
(blueprint: lem-pc-derived-ambient-direct-sums).

Proof: By `lem-pc-scheme-modules-grothendieck-abelian`, module sheaves form a Grothendieck
abelian category, so set-indexed sums exist and are exact. Form the coproduct complex
termwise, with its induced differentials and coprojections. Exactness implies that sums
preserve quasi-isomorphisms. Resolve a target by a K-injective complex; morphisms into it
in the derived category are homotopy classes of chain maps. The degreewise coproduct
property applies to both maps and homotopies, yielding the coproduct universal property
after localization, including empty and singleton families. Finally, exact direct sums
commute with kernels, images, and the quotient of cycles by boundaries. Thus the map
induced by the cohomology of the coprojections is an isomorphism in every integer degree.
Transport along the chosen representative isomorphisms gives coprojections from `E i`. -/
