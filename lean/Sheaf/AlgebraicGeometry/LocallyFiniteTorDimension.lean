/-- `E` locally has finite Tor dimension: every point has an open neighbourhood `U`
and integers `a ≤ b` such that `H^i(E|_U ⊗ᴸ G) = 0` for every `𝒪_U`-module `G` and
every `i ∉ [a, b]`. Here `E|_U` is the derived pullback along the open immersion
`U.ι`, and the vanishing is the scheme predicate
`schemeDerivedTensorCohomologyVanishes` (a K-flat representative whose total tensor
with `G[0]` has zero cohomology in degree `i`; Stacks Tags 06YS and 06YU).
