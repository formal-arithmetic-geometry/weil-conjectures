/-- Degree-zero affine localization, expressed on an open of the ambient scheme.

Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology of Schemes, Lemma 09MR, degree-zero and affine-open
paragraphs; Properties, Lemma 01PW; Cohomology of Sheaves, Lemma 01E1 (2).
(blueprint: lem-sc-invert-s-cohomology-affine-open-zero).

Proof: Regard U as the affine scheme Y = U.toScheme and restrict L, F and s to Y.
Restriction preserves invertibility, quasi-coherence, tensor products, tensor powers
and multiplication by the restricted section. Apply affine_section_localization on Y.
The restricted nonvanishing open is the preimage of S, by the stalk criterion; its
image in X is U ⊓ S. The restriction isomorphisms on sections are natural in the
coefficient module and identify multiplication by s and its tensor powers on Y
with the corresponding maps on U.

The natural isomorphism rightDerivedZeroIsoSelf identifies openModuleCohomology in
degree zero with openModuleSections, since sections are left exact. It commutes with
coefficient morphisms and with restriction of opens (derive the restriction natural
transformation). Thus it identifies every numerator group with sections of the
restricted twist. The direct sum of these additive equivalences carries each
cohomology fraction relation to its section fraction relation. The additive closure
of these section relations equals the underlying additive subgroup of their module
span: multiplying a generator indexed by (n,b,t) by a scalar gives the generator
indexed by (n,b,r • t), because the transition maps are linear. Both inclusions now
follow from the universal properties of additive closure and module span. Hence
the direct-sum equivalence descends to an additive equivalence of the two quotients,
carrying each fraction generator to the corresponding section fraction.

Compose this equivalence with affine_section_localization and the inverse
rightDerivedZeroIsoSelf on U ⊓ S. Naturality in the coefficient module and in open
restriction transports its tensor formula to the displayed equation. In particular,
the section operation tmulSection with s^n is the sections map of
(ρ_ F).inv ≫ F ◁ tensorPowSection (homOfGlobalSection L s) n. For empty U or zero s,
the same construction and quotient argument apply without additional hypotheses. -/
