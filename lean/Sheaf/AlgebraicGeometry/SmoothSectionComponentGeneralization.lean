/-- The relative connected component of a smooth section is stable under generalization.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 055Q, specifically its generic-point argument.
Proof: smoothness supplies flatness and geometrically reduced fibres. Work locally on the
base and descend the finite-presentation morphism and section to a noetherian model,
retaining flatness. The component containing the rational section point commutes with
base change by Tag 055M. For a specialization from x' to x with x in the section component,
choose a trait mapping its generic and special points to x' and x. After base change,
remove the other special-fibre components. The remaining special fibre is connected.
Restrict further to the connected component of the total space containing the section;
it contains the whole special fibre. Tag 055J makes its generic fibre connected, since
the family is flat and the special fibre is geometrically reduced. The trait's second
section through x and x' consequently has its generic point in the component selected
by the original section. Its image x' is in the required locus. Base-change compatibility
returns the conclusion on the original scheme.
