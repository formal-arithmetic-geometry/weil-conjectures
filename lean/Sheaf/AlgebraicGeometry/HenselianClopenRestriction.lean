/-- Restriction to the closed fibre is injective and surjective on clopen subsets.
Source: Stacks Project, Etale Cohomology, Lemma 59.91.1, Tag 0A0B.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-henselian-clopen-restriction)

Proof: The quotient spectrum morphism is a closed immersion, and so is its base change
`i`. The pullback range formula identifies its image `Z` with `f⁻¹(V(I))`. Stein
connectedness for the proper henselian morphism says that `Y` is spectral and that
`Z` meets every irreducible closed subset in a nonempty connected set.

For uniqueness, if two clopens have equal inverse images but differ, one of their
closed differences is nonempty. The closure of a point in that difference is contained
in it and meets `Z`, contradicting equality of the inverse images.

For existence, the closed embedding identifies `Y₀` homeomorphically with `Z`.
Transport the given clopen and its complement across this homeomorphism. Each point
closure meets `Z` in a connected set, so Tag 0CAM lifts this closed decomposition to
a decomposition `Y = U ∐ W` into closed sets. Since `U = Wᶜ`, the set `U` is also open.
The intersection identity for the lifted decomposition, together with injectivity
of `i`, gives `i⁻¹(U) = V`. Empty spaces and empty pieces are included by the same
argument; no nonemptiness of `Y` or of the prescribed clopen is required. -/
