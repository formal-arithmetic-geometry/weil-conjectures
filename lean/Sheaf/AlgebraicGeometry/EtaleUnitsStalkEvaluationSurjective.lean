/-- Surjectivity part of geometric stalk evaluation.

Proof: Let a be a unit of the separable closure, with its multiplicative group
written additively. The subfield L = K(a) inside the separable closure is finite
and separable over K and contains both a and its inverse. Spec L is therefore
etale over Spec K, and the composite embedding of L into the algebraic closure
gives a geometric lift x. Via the global-sections isomorphism for Spec L, a and
its inverse define a unit section z on this neighbourhood. Let t be the germ
of z at x. The evaluation formula for f says that the underlying value of f(t)
embedded in the algebraic closure is the embedded value of a. Injectivity of the
separable-closure embedding, followed by extensionality of units and transport
through the additive wrapper, gives f(t) = a. Thus every target element has a
preimage. This construction uses only separable extensions, even for imperfect K. -/
