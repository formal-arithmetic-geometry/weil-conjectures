/-- For a finitely presented `A`-algebra `C`, vanishing at a prime `q` of both the first
homology of the naive cotangent complex and the Kähler differentials gives an étale
principal neighbourhood of `q` over `Spec A`.

Proof, following the node's four steps:
1. The zero localized differential module is finite free of rank zero. Together with
vanishing of localized H₁ and finite presentation, this gives `g ∉ q` with `C_g` smooth
by `lem-weil-pbc-smooth-at-prime-naive-cotangent-criterion` (07BU).
2. By `lem-weil-pbc-kahler-differentials-localization` (00RT), the differentials of
`C_g` are the localization of those of `C`. They are finite projective, hence finite,
by `def-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map`. Their localization at the prime over `q` is zero.
Choose finite generators and an element outside that prime killing each generator;
the product kills the whole module. Write this product as `c/g^k` with `c ∉ q`.
Then `c` kills the differentials of `C_g`. Put `h = g*c`, which is outside `q`.
3. Identify `C_h` with `(C_g)_c`. By
`lem-weil-pbc-smooth-ring-map-principal-localization` (00T3), it is smooth over `A`.
By localization of differentials (00RT), its differentials vanish. Thus it is finitely
presented with H₁ and differentials zero, hence étale as a ring map (00U1).
4. By `lem-weil-pbc-etale-ring-map-iff-etale-affine` (02GJ), its induced map of
spectra is étale, in the sense of `def-weil-etale-morphism`. -/
