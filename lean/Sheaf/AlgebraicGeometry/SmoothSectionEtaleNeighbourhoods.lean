/-- A section factors through an algebra that is étale near every prime containing
the section kernel. No global étale localization or quotient equivalence is asserted.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 07M7, first paragraph and second paragraph up to
`C_f/JC_f = A/I` (with the source's kernel ideal denoted `N` here).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-smooth-section-etale-neighbourhoods)

Proof:
1. Set `N = ker σ`. Every element of `A/J` comes from `A`, so `σ` is surjective
and `JB ≤ N`. The smooth conormal sequence identifies `P = N/(N² + JB)` with
`Ω[B/A] ⊗[B] (A/J)`, a finite projective `A/J`-module. For the image calculation,
write each `b` modulo `N` as the image of some `a ∈ A`; then
`bj - aj ∈ N²` for every `j ∈ J`.
2. Choose a finite projective complement `Kbar` with `P ⊕ Kbar` finite free.
Lift `Kbar` over an étale neighbourhood `A₁` inducing `A/J ≅ A₁/JA₁` by Tag 07M5.
Base change `B` and the section to `A₁`, and replace the result by its tensor product
with `Sym_{A₁}(K)`, where `K` is the lifted finite projective module. This algebra
is smooth by Tag 07M6, base change and composition. The augmentation retracts it
onto the base-changed original algebra. The new conormal module is `P ⊕ Kbar`:
the augmentation ideal modulo its square is the degree-one part `K`, and tensoring
with the quotient gives `Kbar`. Thus the new conormal module is finite free.
3. Lift its basis to `f₁,...,fₙ` in the section kernel and quotient by their generated
ideal to obtain a finitely presented algebra `E`. The section factors through `E`.
The smooth Jacobi-Zariski sequence identifies the kernel and cokernel of the conormal
map with `H₁(L_{E/A₁})` and `Ω[E/A₁]`. At primes containing the section kernel, the
localized differentials before quotienting have rank `n`, since their reduction has
the chosen basis. Nakayama makes the conormal map surjective. A surjection from the
free module of rank `n` onto its source, followed by that map and an identification
of its target with a free module of rank `n`, is a surjective endomorphism of a finite
module, hence bijective. The conormal map is therefore bijective at these primes,
so both cotangent obstructions vanish.
4. Set `C = E`. Precompose the quotient map with `B → B₁ → B₁ ⊗ Sym(K)`
and transport the section along `A₁/JA₁ ≅ A/J`; this gives `j` and `τ` with `τ ∘ j = σ`.
At every prime containing `ker τ`, step 3 and the cotangent criterion give a principal
localization of `C` étale over `A₁`. Composing with the étale map `A → A₁` makes
that same localization étale over `A`. No global localization has yet been chosen. -/
