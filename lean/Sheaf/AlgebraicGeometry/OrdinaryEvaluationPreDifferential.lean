/-- The signed dual differential gives precomposition in the input complex.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 08DQ, ordinary evaluation calculation, and Section 20.41.
(blueprint: lem-pc-ordinary-evaluation-pre-differential).

Proof: Both sides vanish unless r+q=-1. Expand the dual differential after
its projection to Hom(P^r,O[0]^(r+q+1)). The postcomposition term is zero
because the single complex has zero differential. The remaining term is
-(-1)^q times precomposition by d_P. Move this term through evaluation by
naturality of the tensor-Hom equivalence in its input and its tensor source.
Additivity of currying and tensoring moves the scalar outside. The tensor
sign (-1)^p combines with (-1)^q to give (-1)^n since p+q=n. The transport
in F identifies (r+1)+n with r+m, with no choice of data. If r+q is not -1,
the projections involved have zero target, so the same identity holds with
both sides zero. Zero modules and empty opens require no separate assumption. -/
