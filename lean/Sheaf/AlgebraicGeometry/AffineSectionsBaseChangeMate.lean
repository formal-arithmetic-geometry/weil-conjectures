/-- The affine sections comparison intertwines the extension/restriction mate with
sheaf base change, followed by the pullback/direct-image mate of any morphism.
The supplied sections comparison is normalized on sheaves and right-derived units.
Only the pushforward of E is required to have quasi-coherent cohomology; neither
Tor independence nor invertibility of the morphism or of base change is required.

Proof:
1. Derived direct-image composition and exact scalar restriction give a natural
   isomorphism Rf'_* followed by RΓ over B with RΓ over f'. On sheaves it is the
   identity on sections, and the composition of right-derived units specifies its
   derived normalization. The same construction over R identifies RΓ over f with
   RΓ over Spec R after Rf_*.
2. For Q = Rf_*E, use the affine quasi-coherent derived equivalence on Spec R
   and Spec B. Resolve its module model by a K-flat complex. The tilde/pullback
   formula identifies Lg*Q with tilde of extension of scalars. The extension and
   restriction adjunction on these complexes descends to localization. Compare
   the descended adjunction with the fixed affineDerivedExtensionAdjunction by
   uniqueness of left adjoints to the fixed derived restriction functor. This
   yields the source isomorphism a commuting with the adjunction units. Compose
   with extension of the inverse sections/pushforward isomorphism of step 1.
3. Transpose the displayed right-hand composite under affine extension/restriction.
   By the unit compatibility of a this is RΓ of the unit for Lg*, followed by
   restriction of the sections of sheaf base change and of the mate of m.
   Expand base change as the mate of pullback composition and the counit for f.
   Naturality moves m past the counit; the triangle identities cancel the unit
   and counit pairs. Direct-image composition identifies what remains with RΓ(m)
   followed by the sections comparison for g_X. On K-injective models both
   sections comparisons act as the identity on sections. The supplied underived
   identity and right-derived-unit equation therefore identify this comparison
   with c. Equality on all objects follows by the right-derived universal property.
4. Apply injectivity of the affine adjunction Hom equivalence. The construction
   of a and the target sections isomorphism does not depend on L or m, giving
   the stated simultaneous equality. -/
