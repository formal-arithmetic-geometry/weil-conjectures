/-! # The direct-image algebra and its quasi-coherent derived category

Source: Stacks Project, Derived Categories of Schemes, Tag 0AVW
(blueprint: def-sc-direct-image-algebra-derived-category).

## Main definitions

* `directImageAlgebraSpace` is the ringed space `(Y, f_* O_X)`.
* `toDirectImageAlgebraSpace` is its canonical morphism from `(X, O_X)`.
* `directImageAlgebraDerivedQCohProperty` and `directImageAlgebraDerivedQCohCategory`
  specify quasi-coherent cohomology over the direct-image algebra.
