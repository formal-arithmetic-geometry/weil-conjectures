/-- Canonical comparisons commute with whole-to-open and open-to-open restriction.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 03F3 (2), and Tag 0A50, proof.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-etale-resolution-section-canonical-restriction)

Proof: Represent a homology class by a cycle. The Hom-to-sections adjunction
 identifies this cycle with a morphism from the constant integer sheaf, or the
 free abelian representable sheaf, to the corresponding term of I. Restricting
 the section precomposes that morphism with the representing free sheaf map.
 `I.mk₀_comp_extMk` therefore describes the resulting Ext class. For the
 whole-to-open map, pulling back the constant cocycle and precomposing with
 the identity generator is the adjunction unit, and hence `cohomologyMap W.ι`.
 For an inclusion A ≤ B the same calculation, with the two inverse-image
 composition comparisons, gives `openCohomologyRestriction`. Naturality of
 the identity generator cancels the intermediate constant-sheaf comparisons.
 The normalization fields of c evaluate the original and restricted cycles
 by these independently specified Ext classes, so the two displayed
 equalities follow. Every homology class has a cycle representative because
 homologyπ is an epimorphism of abelian groups. The argument also applies to
 degree zero, identities, empty opens, and the zero sheaf. -/
