/-- The canonical cocone of fixed-base cohomology is a colimit. This asserts only the
universal property for supplied diagram and cocone data; it does not construct them.

Proof:
1. Choose a small nonempty directed partial order A and a final functor A to J opposite
   by the cofiltered limit directed reindexing lemma (Stacks 0032). Its opposite is
   initial, so whiskering c gives a limit cone with the same point. The reindexed
   schemes are qcqs and their transition maps are affine by the given instances.
2. At a stage take the inverse image of G along the structure map to S. The inverse
   of upperStarComp gives the sheaf transition map, using naturality of pi. The
   unit and associativity coherence of inverse-image composition give its identity
   and composition laws. The hypotheses hH identify the reindexed H with its
   canonical cohomology diagram.
3. On the limit use the constant diagram with value t inverse image G. The equations
   ht and upperStarComp identify this diagram with the pulled-back stage sheaves.
   Associativity coherence gives compatibility of these identifications with the
   transitions. A nonempty directed category is connected, so the identity cocone
   on this constant diagram is a colimit of the limit sheaves.
4. Apply nonempty_isColimit_etale_cohomology_of_isLimit (Stacks 09YQ) to this reindexed
   system and this constant sheaf colimit. Its specified comparison legs are exactly
   the right sides of hB. Thus the whiskering of B is a colimit cocone.
5. Finality reflects the colimit universal property of B, giving the result on J
   opposite. The isomorphisms eH and eB only transport objects and do not change this
   property. Neither the source theorem nor this argument requires torsion.

Edge cases: the index is nonempty by cofilteredness; the one-object case reduces to
an isomorphism cocone. Zero sheaves, empty schemes and degree zero require no changes.
