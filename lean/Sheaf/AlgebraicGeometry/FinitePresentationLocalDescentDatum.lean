/-- Local modules and their overlap identifications descend to one finite stage.
Source: Stacks Project, Limits, Tag 01ZR, first proof, general case.
(blueprint: lem-pc-fp-local-descent-datum).

Proof: Choose a finite affine cover of Xi. On each member, its base-change rings form
an affine directed colimit. Apply the object clause of Tag 05N7 to descend the
restriction of M. Choose finite affine covers of the pairwise overlaps, their
refinement overlaps, and the triple overlaps. Apply the map clause of 05N7 to the
comparison maps and their inverses. Apply its equality clause to the inverse
identities, agreement on refinement overlaps, and cocycle equations. There are
finitely many data and equations; pass to a common later stage, using directedness.
The comparison maps glue on each overlap to isomorphisms satisfying the cocycle.
They define the descent datum D, with finitely presented quasi-coherent components.
After base change, the component comparisons to M respect the cocycle and therefore
form the asserted isomorphism of descent data. This statement constructs only local
modules and transition maps, not a global module on the stage. For empty Xi use the
empty cover and its unique descent datum. Noetherianity is unnecessary. -/
