/-- An injective resolution can be lifted to the larger coefficient universe, and
its evaluation complexes are the lifts of the original evaluation complexes.

`AffineEtale.sheafEquiv` and `AddCommGrpCat.uliftFunctor`.
(blueprint: lem-sc-etale-ulift-injective-resolution)

Proof: Restrict to the u-small model of the affine étale site, using
`AffineEtale.sheafEquiv`, then an equivalence with a u-small skeleton of the
essentially u-small affine site. Transport the topology along this equivalence.
On this small site, the free abelian sheaf on each
representable has u-small values. Indeed the representable and its free abelian
presheaf have u-small values, and sheafification uses only u-small limits and
colimits. ULift preserves these constructions. Every subsheaf of the lifted free
representable is u-small objectwise; shrinking these values transports its group
structure and restriction maps to a u-valued sheaf. The inclusion is then the lift
of a monomorphism in the smaller sheaf category. If I is injective there, every map
from this subsheaf to the lift of I extends over the free representable, by full
faithfulness of ULift and injectivity of I. The injectivity criterion of Tag 01DO
therefore proves that the lift of I is injective in the larger sheaf category.
The site equivalence commutes with coefficient lift, so this holds on X.Etale too.

Coefficient lift is exact: kernels are computed objectwise and ULift preserves
them; epimorphisms of sheaves are locally surjective, and local surjectivity is
unchanged by lift. It is additive and commutes with the single complex. Thus
applying coefficient lift degreewise to R and its augmentation gives an injective
resolution S of the lifted sheaf. Evaluating at each U commutes with coefficient
lift on objects and maps, so the complexes in the conclusion are canonically
isomorphic. This includes the empty scheme and the zero sheaf, and requires no
quasi-coherence or affine hypothesis on X. -/
