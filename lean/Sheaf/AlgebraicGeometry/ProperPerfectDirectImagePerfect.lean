/-- Derived direct image along a proper perfect morphism over a Noetherian base
preserves perfect objects. Perfectness of the morphism is expressed by the equivalent
stalkwise finite Tor criterion of Stacks Lemma 37.61.11.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Morphisms, Lemma 37.61.13, Tag 0B6G.
Proof: (1) Properness (def-weil-proper-morphism) gives finite type, a Noetherian source,
and proper supports for the coherent cohomology of P. Locally P has a bounded strictly
perfect representative (def-pc-perfect-complex), so its cohomology is coherent. A finite
open cover of the quasi-compact source makes the cohomological bounds uniform. The
finite Tor dimension of the source local rings implies that these local representatives
have finite Tor dimension over the inverse image of the target structure sheaf; local
bounds become uniform by quasi-compactness.
(2) Apply lem-pc-bounded-coherent-finite-tor-proper-pushforward-perfect (Stacks Tag 08EV)
with S = Y and E = P: the target is Noetherian, f is locally of finite type, P is bounded
coherent, its supports are proper, and its relative Tor dimension is finite. The
criterion concludes that Rf_*P is perfect on Y.
