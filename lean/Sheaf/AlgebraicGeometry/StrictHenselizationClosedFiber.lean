/-- The only point of the strict henselization over the underlying geometric point is
its closed point, in any local affine presentation.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-strict-henselization-closed-fiber)

Proof: choose an affine neighbourhood Spec R of the image p of s. The pointed etale
coordinate-ring colimit is the strict henselization of R_p (Tag 04HX): localizing each
neighbourhood at its selected prime does not change the colimit, since every element
outside that prime becomes invertible on a smaller pointed open neighbourhood. Its
maximal ideal is p times the colimit ring, and its quotient is the separable algebraic
closure of the residue field of p inside Ω. In particular that quotient is a field.
Thus the fibre over p has exactly one prime, the maximal ideal: primes over p contain
p times the colimit ring, and conversely that maximal ideal contracts to p. Under the
isomorphism e this point is the closed point of A, since an isomorphism of spectra
preserves closed points and a local ring has a unique closed point. Both implications
of the displayed equivalence follow. This argument also covers a field A, whose
closed point is its zero ideal. -/
