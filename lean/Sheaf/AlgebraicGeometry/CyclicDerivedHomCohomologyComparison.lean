/-- Free-representable derived Hom computes cohomology on the fibre product, and geometric
restriction to zero forces the corresponding presheaf restriction to zero.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 03Q8, the restricted cohomology presheaf; the free-sheaf
adjunction argument in
`WeilConjectures/SixFunctors/Etale/SmoothBaseChange/HigherDirectImage/FreeSheaf.lean`.
(blueprint: lem-sbc-cyclic-derived-hom-cohomology-comparison).

Proof: The free abelian sheaf on an etale representable corepresents evaluation. Pullback
along h takes the free sheaf on W to the free sheaf on Y times_X W, as follows from the
pullback/direct-image adjunction and the section-corepresenting universal property.
Extension by zero along the etale projection Y times_X W to Y takes the constant free
abelian sheaf to this free representable sheaf. Extension by zero is exact and left
adjoint to restriction; its derived adjunction therefore identifies Hom from the
free representable in degree zero to F[0][q] with Ext^q from the constant integer sheaf
to F restricted to Y times_X W. This is Sheaf.H. The canonical pullback identification
for constant cyclic sheaves identifies the latter coefficients with Z/e on that fibre
product. The evaluation adjunctions are natural in W: precomposition with the free
map induced by v corresponds to cohomologyMap of the induced fibre-product morphism,
followed by the constant-coefficient isomorphism. That isomorphism and the additive
comparison preserve and reflect zero, giving the implication displayed here.
No affine, nonempty, positive-degree, or nonzero-modulus hypothesis is used. -/
