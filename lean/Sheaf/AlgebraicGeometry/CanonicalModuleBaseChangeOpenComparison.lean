/-- Restriction identifies the module base-change arrow with the arrow of the
chosen pullback of the restricted maps. No affine chart is used.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 08FE, proof; Tag 08HY, counit construction;
Tag 08IB, first proof paragraph; Tag 0D5U, exact extension by zero.
(blueprint: lem-pc-canonical-module-base-change-open-comparison).

Proof:
1. Put U = f inverse image of V and Z = f' inverse image of W. The restricted
square with vertices Z,U,W,V is cartesian: a map to U and W agreeing over V
composes to a cone for the original square, whose unique lift lands in Z.
Identify Z with the chosen pullback of f restricted to V and g restricted from
W to V. Both projections agree under this identification.
2. Apply the pullback restriction comparison to g and direct-image restriction
to f. Exact restriction takes G[0] to H[0], yielding a. Apply direct-image
restriction to f', and identify restriction of g'^*G with the ordinary pullback
of H under the first projection, yielding b. These are isomorphisms.
3. Unpack hc as a left-derived counit epsilon. For a complex K on U, evaluate
epsilon on its termwise extension by zero to X, restrict the result to Z, and
use the projection comparisons to regard it as a counit for the first projection.
Extension by zero is exact and preserves K-flatness: tensoring an extension by
zero with a test complex is extension by zero of the tensor with its restriction,
and both restriction and extension by zero preserve acyclicity. Thus the new
counit is invertible on K-flat representatives and has the left-derived universal
property. Naturality at the extension-by-zero counit j_!(M|U) -> M shows that its
value on M|U agrees with epsilon on M restricted to Z. In particular this holds
for M = G[0]. Compose the value on H[0] with the single-complex identification
to obtain c0 and its comparison predicate. This transports the supplied epsilon,
including any automorphism in its choice, rather than choosing an unrelated one.
4. Transpose the derived mate of Tag 08HY under the restricted adjunction.
The open-square identity for underived mates commutes with restriction on
complexes. Localizing and using the derived adjunction equations gives the same
identity for the derived mate. Naturality of the direct-image restriction
comparison then composes this identity with the transported epsilon, giving the
displayed square. No invertibility of the base-change arrow is asserted.
The argument is valid for empty opens and the zero module. -/
