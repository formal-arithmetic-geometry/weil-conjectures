/-- Reduced differentials of a symmetric stabilization split into the original
reduced differentials and the scalar extension of the stabilizing module.

Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Tag 07M7, first paragraph; differentials
of tensor products and the universal property of the symmetric algebra.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-symmetric-stabilization-differentials)

Proof: write S = Sym_A₁(K) and D = S tensor_A B. The universal property of
A₁-derivations on D identifies them with a pair consisting of an A₁-derivation
on S and an A-derivation on B. A derivation on S is uniquely determined by an
A₁-linear map from K, because S is the symmetric algebra. The universal
property of Kahler differentials therefore gives the direct sum of
D tensor_B Omega[B/A] and D tensor_A₁ K. Tensor this identity with Q over D.
Associativity and cancellation of tensor products give Q tensor_B Omega[B/A]
and Q tensor_A₁ K. The two compatibility equations ensure that the B and A₁
scalar actions are exactly those specified by sigma and eta. Finite products
are direct sums of modules. This argument requires neither smoothness nor
nonzero rings and works also for K = 0.
