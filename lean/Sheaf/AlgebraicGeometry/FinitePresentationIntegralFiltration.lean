/-- A finitely presented module on a Noetherian scheme has a finite filtration whose
quotients are pushforwards of ideals on integral closed subschemes.

Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology of Schemes, Lemma 30.12.3, Tag 01YF.
(blueprint: lem-pc-e2-finite-presentation-integral-filtration)

Proof: Use Noetherian induction on closed subsets of X, with induction assertion that
all finitely presented modules whose support closure is contained in the given closed
set have the asserted filtration. The support-reduction filtration gives a finite chain
with quotients either already integral-ideal pushforwards or finitely presented modules
with strictly smaller support closure. For a smaller-support quotient, its closure is
strictly below the closed induction bound by transitivity, so apply the induction
hypothesis. Integral-ideal quotients need no induction. The predicate of being an
integral-ideal pushforward is invariant under isomorphism, by composing the witnessing
isomorphisms. Apply finite_filtration_refinement to refine all smaller-support factors
at once and obtain a chain with only integral-ideal quotients. Apply the induction
assertion to F and its own support closure. The geometric support-reduction theorem
contains the reducible-support, J-adic and generic-inclusion parts of Tag 01YF, but does
not filter smaller-support factors. The refinement theorem is fully proved using the
source library's extension-closed filtrationClosure and conversion to subobjects. -/
