the prefix labelled-deletion argument of the parent node.

Proof: For an outgoing index (σ,a,τ,r), r<a implies r<p+2. Put j=σ(r)=τ(r).
Delete position r and label j from σ and τ, renumbering all remaining labels by
j.succAbove, and put b=a-1. Stable sorting is preserved because the increasing
renumbering preserves the tie-breaking order on labels. The restricted τ agrees
with the restricted σ before b and remains increasing from b onward, so it is the
partial sort with prefix b. Since r<a, the omitted pair (t(j),j) precedes the
remaining junction pair.
Conversely, for an incoming (j,σ',b,τ'), insert j at its rank r in the stable order
of the full label set. The before condition says r≤b, hence r<b+1. Insert j into
both smaller permutations at position r and set a=b+1. Their prefixes agree,
and increasing tails and stable sorting are preserved. Deletion and insertion
are inverse, since the stable rank is unique and increasing renumbering is
injective. This includes b=0 and b=p, and repeated t-values are resolved by the
original labels; for an empty I there is no input t.
No signs or sums occur in this correspondence.
