/-- A higher direct image section vanishing on a principal open is power torsion.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01XJ (1), via localization in Tag 09MR and Tag 01E4.
(blueprint: lem-pc-higher-direct-image-section-torsion).

Proof:
Work on an affine open W = Spec A of the base. The inverse image Y = f⁻¹W is
quasi-compact and quasi-separated, since f is qcqs and W is affine. Here H^q
means right-derived module sections, as in RingedSpace.openModuleCohomology;
no comparison with the source library's abelian-sheaf Ext model is needed.
For each a in A, its pullback b is a global function on Y, and f⁻¹D(a) = D(b).
Apply cohomology localization (Tag 09MR)
with the tensor unit as the invertible module: the restriction map identifies
H^q(D(b), ℱ) with H^q(Y, ℱ)[1/b]. Under the unit tensor identifications,
the fraction relations are [n, x] = [n+k, b^k x]. The canonical formula
x/b^n ↦ b^(-n) res(x) proves A-linearity, since restriction is linear and
b is invertible on D(b). It also proves compatibility with further principal
restrictions: both composites send each fraction to the same restricted
numerator divided by the same power. These fractions generate the localization.
Doing this for all principal opens in W identifies the cohomology presheaf on
that basis with the sections of the associated A-module H^q(Y, ℱ). This is a
sheaf on the principal-open basis (localization is exact and satisfies the
finite principal-cover equalizer condition). The higher direct image is the
sheafification of the cohomology presheaf by Tag 01E4, so this identification
also identifies its sections and restriction maps on W and D(a). It does not
use the affine sections comparison in DirectImage.Sections, whose proof needs
quasi-coherence; instead it uses the cohomology presheaf and its sheafification.
If t restricts to zero on D(a), the fraction t/1 is zero in the localized
module. The zero criterion for module localization gives a^n t = 0 for some n.
This includes q = 0, a = 0 (choose n = 1), units a (then t = 0), the zero
module and empty W. This is only the kernel assertion; it gives no lifting of
sections on the principal open. -/
