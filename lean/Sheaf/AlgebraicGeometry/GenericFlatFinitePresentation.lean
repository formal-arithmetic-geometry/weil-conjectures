/-- A finite type map to an integral scheme is flat and locally finitely presented
on a nonempty open of the base.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 052A, applied to the structure sheaf.
Proof: replace the integral base by a nonempty affine open Spec A, where A is a
domain. Cover its inverse image by finitely many affine opens Spec B_i, using
quasi-compactness. Each B_i is a finite type A-algebra. Tag 051T, applied with
M = B_i, gives a nonzero a_i in A such that (B_i)_{a_i} is free over A_{a_i}
and finitely presented as an A_{a_i}-algebra. Invert the product of these finitely
many a_i. This product is nonzero, so its basic open is nonempty. Flatness and
local finite presentation hold on the resulting affine cover of the inverse
image, hence hold for the restricted map by locality on the source. If the
inverse image is empty, use the empty product 1; both properties are vacuous.
No noetherianity or separatedness hypothesis is needed.
