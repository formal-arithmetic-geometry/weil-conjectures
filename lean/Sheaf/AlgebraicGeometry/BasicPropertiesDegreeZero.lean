Proof (agent argument specialized from the parent node):
1. Global sections preserves kernels, computed sectionwise in module sheaves. For an
   injective resolution J of G, the augmentation therefore identifies G(Y) with the
   degree-zero cycles of its sections complex. Since the complex has natural indices,
   there are no degree-zero boundaries. The comparison with the right derived functor
   gives eG : H^0(Y,G) ≅ G(Y); construct eF in the same way on X.
2. Evaluate the equation J.ι.f 0 followed by beta.f 0 = phi followed by
   pushforward of I.ι.f 0 followed by lambda.f 0 at the whole space Y. Under the
   canonical restriction along h^{-1}(Y) = X this says that mu sends the augmented
   section I.ι(phi(s)) to beta(J.ι(s)), for every section s of G.
3. Passing to cycles and degree-zero homology preserves this equality. Since homology
   of mu is invertible, its inverse sends beta(J.ι(s)) to I.ι(phi(s)). Transport by the
   resolution comparisons and forgetful homology comparisons in the definition of
   moduleCohomologyFMap. This gives the asserted equality after eG and eF.
