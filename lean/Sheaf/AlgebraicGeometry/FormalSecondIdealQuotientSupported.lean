/-- The second-ideal quotient system is annihilated by the closed thickening's ideal.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 088A, construction of G_e.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-formal-second-ideal-quotient-supported).

Proof: At I-level n the system is M_n/K^(e+1)M_n, so the cokernel quotient
construction makes multiplication by the recursively defined K-power zero.
The kernel ideal of the closed immersion V(K^(e+1)) into X is K^(e+1).
On each affine open the section images of its associated ideal module and of the
recursively constructed ideal power are both the ideal K(U)^(e+1). Hence their
products with the quotient module have the same zero image there. The quotient
and ideal products are quasi-coherent. Equality on the affine basis therefore
makes the product inclusion zero globally, and its monomorphism proves the
product object is zero. This establishes the asserted annihilation at every n;
no algebraization or compatibility of algebraization choices is required. -/
