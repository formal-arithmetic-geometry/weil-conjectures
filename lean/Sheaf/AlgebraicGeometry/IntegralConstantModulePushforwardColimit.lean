/-- An integral direct image of a finite constant module sheaf on a Noetherian base is
a small filtered colimit of finite direct images of the same constant module.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 09Z6, final paragraph of the proof of (1), transferred to (3),
using Tags 09YZ and 09Z1.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-integral-constant-module-pushforward-colimit).

Proof: Present the integral morphism nu as a cofiltered limit of finite X-schemes with
an index category of size u, using its finite approximation. Each transition map is affine,
and each structure map and nu are affine, hence quasi-compact and quasi-separated. Reverse
the index category to form a filtered diagram D of direct images of the constant module M.
The transition map is obtained from the inverse-image unit and the canonical comparison
between the pullback of a constant sheaf and the constant sheaf with the same value.
Functoriality follows from naturality of the unit and the inverse-image composition
comparison. The limit projections define a compatible cocone into nu_* M. The pullbacks
of the constant sheaves to the limit are canonically constant, with all transition maps
identified with identities; their colimit is constant M since the index is nonempty and
connected. The relative colimit theorem 09Z1 in degree zero identifies the cocone as a
colimit on underlying abelian sheaves. Forgetting modules preserves and creates filtered
colimits of sheaves, computed by sheafifying sectionwise module colimits, so the cocone is
also a module-sheaf colimit. Take Z and f from the finite approximation and the stage
isomorphisms from the definition of D. This includes zero M and the empty scheme. -/
