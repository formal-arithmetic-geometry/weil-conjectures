/-- Evaluation at the represented identity induces an isomorphism in every degree.

Proof: Put V = U times_S Y and r : V -> Y. The free abelian Yoneda and
sheafification adjunctions, followed by h^* adjoint to h_*, identify maps from
h^* of the free represented sheaf of U to any sheaf G with G(V). The identity
under this identification is exactly the section called generator in the map
construction. Restriction r^* preserves injectives: its left adjoint r_! is exact,
since stalks are direct sums over lifts and geometric stalks detect exactness.
Take a bounded-below injective resolution I of F. Maps from the single free
sheaf to I[p], modulo homotopy, are the p-th cohomology of the complex of sections
I(V), by the preceding additive sections adjunction. Restriction computes the
same complex on V and remains K-injective. The localization bijection for a
K-injective target and full faithfulness of D+ into D identify these homotopy
classes with the raw derived Hom source. The comparison map applies restricted
derived sections to the class and evaluates at generator; on I this sends a
class represented by a chain map to its corresponding section cocycle, so it
is the above bijection. The zeroIso and shiftIso factors are precisely the
single-complex and shift identifications in this computation. Thus the map is
an additive bijection, hence an isomorphism. For p=0 the argument is the ordinary
sections adjunction. For empty V both the sections complex and the raw Hom
complex vanish; the same computation applies without a nonemptiness assumption. -/
