/-- The generic-residue-field case of support induction: the coherent cokernel of
the generic ideal inclusion has smaller support, and its filtration can be appended.
Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology of Schemes, Lemma 01YF, proof, final paragraph,
using Lemma 01YE (coherent_generic_point_ideal_inclusion).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-coherent-integral-filtration-generic-step)

Proof: endow T with its reduced induced structure i : Z -> X, integral because ξ is
its generic point. Identify the image of genericPoint Z with ξ by uniqueness of generic
points in a scheme. Apply the generic-point ideal inclusion to F and hkill, obtaining
a mono α : i_*(I^{⊕ r}) -> F, an ideal I coherent on Z, and an isomorphism near ξ.
The stalk F_ξ is nonzero since ξ belongs to T = Supp F, so r is positive and I is nonzero;
use the closed-pushforward stalk comparison to rule out r = 0 and I = 0.
The scheme Z is locally Noetherian since its closed immersion is locally of finite type.
Thus i_*I is coherent by the closed-pushforward coherent equivalence. Pushforward
commutes with finite sums. The partial sums of (i_*I)^{⊕ r} give a coherent filtration
of the source of α, each quotient isomorphic to i_*I. Transport it to im α.
The cokernel Q of α is coherent and supported in T by exactness of stalks. Its stalk
at ξ is zero because α is an isomorphism near ξ; therefore its closed support is strictly
smaller than T. Apply hsmaller to Q. Append its pulled-back filtration to the image
filtration using coherentIntegralFiltration_of_shortExact. This proves the conclusion
only in the generic-annihilated case; it does not assert the ideal-power reduction. -/
