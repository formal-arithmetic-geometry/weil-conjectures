/-- A proper finitely presented scheme over a Noetherian approximation descends to
one proper stage, with its pullback square retained.
Source: Stacks Project, Limits, Tags 01ZM and 081F, as used in Tag 0A0P.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-proper-noetherian-stage)
Proof: reindex N by a nonempty directed set using Tag 0032. Apply
finite-presentation descent to its limiting cone. This gives a finitely presented
stage morphism p and a cartesian square with g.
The stage source is qcqs because p is finitely presented and the base is Noetherian.
Apply properness descent (081F) to p and the identity of its base: its limit base
change is g, hence proper. Pull back p to the stage supplied by 081F. Properness
holds there; finite presentation is preserved by base change. Pasting pullback
squares gives the displayed square with g and the original approximation leg.
The resulting stage in the directed reindexing is an object of N.I. -/
