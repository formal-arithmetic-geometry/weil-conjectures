/-- Finite local freeness of degree `d` descends along a jointly surjective étale family.
Source: Stacks Project, Descent, Lemma 02VO, using Topologies, Lemma 022C
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-locally-free-degree-etale-descent).

Proof:
1. The family is an fpqc covering (`def-weil-pbc-fpqc-covering`). Each member is flat
   (`def-weil-etale-morphism`). For an affine open of the target, cover its inverse images
   by affine opens (`def-pc-scheme`). Their images are open
   (`lem-weil-pbc-etale-morphism-open-map`), cover that affine open by joint surjectivity,
   and admit a finite subcover (`lem-weil-pbc-affine-scheme-qcqs`). This is the proof of 022C.
2. Each second projection (`def-pc-fibre-product`) is finite by the hypothesis
   (`def-pc-finite-locally-free`). Thus `h` is finite by
   `lem-weil-pbc-fpqc-descend-finite` applied to the fpqc covering from step 1.
3. Each second projection is flat, so `h` is flat by `lem-weil-pbc-fpqc-descend-flat`.
4. Each second projection is locally of finite presentation, so `h` is locally of finite
   presentation by `lem-weil-pbc-fpqc-descend-locally-finite-presentation`. With steps 2 and 3
   this gives finite local freeness (`def-pc-finite-locally-free`).
5. For any target point `t`, its fibre over its residue field (`def-weil-residue-field`,
   `def-pc-scheme-fibre`) is finite by `lem-weil-pbc-finite-morphism-permanence`. Let its
   degree be `e` (`def-weil-pbc-fibre-degree-bound`). Choose a point over `t` in a member
   of the cover. By `lem-weil-pbc-fibre-degree-base-change` the corresponding fibre of the
   second projection has the same degree `e`; its degree is `d` by hypothesis. Hence `e = d`
   at every target point, as required by `def-pc-finite-locally-free`. -/
