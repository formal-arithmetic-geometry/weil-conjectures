/-- The supported Koszul gluing step for a finite affine cover with at least two members.
The hypothesis supplies zero detectors only for schemes with strictly smaller covers.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0A9A, the open-cover induction paragraphs.
(blueprint: lem-pc-supported-perfect-detector-gluing).

Proof:
1. Choose a member V of s and put U equal to the union of the remaining members.
   The latter give an affine cover of U with at most card(s)-1 members: restrict the
   remaining charts, each already contained in U. Thus the induction hypothesis applies
   to U and T intersect U. U is quasi-compact and quasi-separated; its complement of T
   is quasi-compact by quasi-separatedness of X. Restriction and the module equivalence
   for an open subscheme supply derived localizations in the same Hom universe. Apply
   the hypothesis to these localizations, obtaining a perfect supported detector P on U.
2. Apply exists_perfect_supported_map_lift to P, the zero quasi-coherent object on X,
   and the zero map. It gives a perfect Q supported on T with P a retract of Q restricted
   to U. No global detection property is assumed in this step.
3. Put Z = X minus U and W = V minus (Z intersect T). This open is the union of U
   intersect V and V minus T, hence quasi-compact. Choose a finite tuple cutting out
   Z intersect T on the affine V and form its Koszul complex K. It is perfect and
   supported on Z intersect T. supported_open_pushforward identifies K' = Ri_*K
   with extension by zero and makes it perfect and supported on T. Form Q plus K'.
4. If all shifted maps from this sum to a supported object E vanish, they vanish from
   each summand. Exact extension-by-zero adjunction gives orthogonality to K on V.
   koszul_open_orthogonality makes E restricted to V the pushforward from W.
5. On W the support is T intersect U intersect V, closed in W and contained in U
   intersect V. supported_open_pushforward and derived direct-image composition
   identify this pushforward with that from U intersect V. Open restriction base change
   then shows the canonical unit E to Rj_*(E restricted to U) is invertible on U and V.
   Its cone has zero cohomology stalks on this cover, hence is zero globally.
6. Derived adjunction and the retract P of Q restricted to U give vanishing of every
   shifted Hom from P to E restricted to U. The detector P makes this restriction zero,
   and step 5 makes E zero. The finite sum Q plus K' is perfect, quasi-coherent and
   supported on T, so it is the claimed detector. Empty U and redundant affine charts
   are allowed; the strictly smaller cover condition remains valid. -/
