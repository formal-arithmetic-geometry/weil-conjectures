/-- The closed degree-at-most-r locus on an affine open has finitely many equations.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Morphisms, Tag 07RZ, proof, second paragraph
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-qf-degree-sublevel-finite-equations).

Proof: identify W with Spec A and write its closed sublevel locus as V(I). On W,
the lower bound r identifies the sublevel locus with the degree-r locus. Thus the
universal degree criterion makes the pullback to Spec(A/I) finite locally free of
rank r. The quotient A/I is the filtered colimit of A/J over finitely generated
subideals J of I, so its spectrum is the inverse limit of those quotient spectra.
The restriction of f to W is quasi-compact, separated, and locally of finite
presentation, hence finitely presented. Descent of finite local freeness with
specified rank gives a finitely generated J contained in I for which the
pullback to Spec(A/J) has rank r. The degree criterion implies V(J) is contained
in the degree-r locus V(I). Since J is contained in I, the reverse inclusion also
holds. Choose a finite generating set t of J. At every point of W, membership
in V(J) is equivalent to lying outside every basic open D(a), a in t. This is
the asserted equivalence. Empty W and the zero ideal permit t empty; the unit
ideal permits t containing 1, so no nonemptiness assumption is needed. -/
