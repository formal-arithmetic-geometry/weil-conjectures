/-- On an affine open in the degree-at-least-r locus, the degree-at-least-(r+1)
locus is quasi-compact. The closed sublevel locus and the universal degree-r
criterion are explicit hypotheses, so this is only the descent step of the argument.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Morphisms, Tag 07RZ, proof, second paragraph
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-qf-degree-successor-affine-compact).

Proof: Since W lies in the degree-at-least-r locus, the closed sublevel locus
restricted to W is precisely the degree-r locus. Write W as Spec A and that closed
locus as V(I). The quotient-spectrum morphism Spec(A/I) → S has image in the
degree-r locus, so the assumed universal criterion makes its base change finite
locally free of degree r. Write I as the directed union of its finitely generated
subideals; Spec(A/I) is the inverse limit of their quotient spectra with affine
transition maps. The restriction of f to W is quasi-compact (because f is) and
quasi-separated (because f is separated over an affine), and locally of finite
presentation. Descent of finite local freeness and its degree therefore gives a
finitely generated subideal J of I whose quotient-spectrum base change is finite
locally free of degree r. The universal criterion forces V(J) to lie in V(I).
The opposite inclusion follows from J ⊆ I, so V(J) = V(I). The complement is the
finite union of the basic opens of generators of J. Basic opens in an affine scheme
are quasi-compact, and a finite union is quasi-compact. This is exactly the required
intersection. The argument includes empty W, the zero ideal, and the unit ideal. -/
