/-- A raw resolution cohomology class vanishing on a principal open is killed by
some power of its defining function. This is only the kernel assertion and makes
no claim that classes on the principal open lift.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 09MR, Lemma 30.17.3, injectivity of the canonical map
and the zero criterion for fractions; Tag 01E4, Lemma 20.7.3.
(blueprint: lem-pc-section-cohomology-principal-torsion).

Proof: Put Y = f⁻¹W and let b be the pullback of a. The affineness of W and
qcqs hypotheses on f make Y qcqs. Restrict F and I to Y; open restriction
preserves quasi-coherence and injectives. Taking sections of I on Y and D(b)
identifies their cohomology with P(W) and P(D(a)), since f⁻¹D(a)=D(b).
The identifications come from the degreewise section identities for pushforward,
so they commute with restriction and multiplication by the pulled-back function.
Apply invertS_cohomology on Y to the tensor unit and its section b. Under the
unit tensor identifications, the fraction [0,x] maps to the restriction of x:
the canonical equation at exponent zero is precisely that equality. Thus the
hypothesis makes its image zero. Injectivity of the comparison makes [0,x]
zero in the fraction presentation. Apply cohomologyFraction_eventually_zero
at index zero to obtain an exponent n for which multiplication by b^n kills
x. Under the unit identifications its tensor transition is multiplication by
b^n, and under the section-complex identification this is the scalar action
of a^n on P(W). This gives the required equation. For a=0 choose n=1; for
unit a the restriction is an isomorphism, so x=0 and n=0 works. The same
argument includes q=0, the zero coefficient module, and empty W. -/
