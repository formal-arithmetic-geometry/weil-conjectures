/-- A smooth section admits, after an étale base extension and symmetric-algebra
stabilization, a finite basis of differentials represented by elements of its kernel.
This asserts no étaleness for the enlarged algebra or any quotient of it.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 07M7, first paragraph and the choice of the `fᵢ` in the
second paragraph. (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-smooth-section-differential-basis)

Proof:
1. The section is surjective since the structure map to `A/J` is surjective. Apply
   the smooth conormal sequence to identify its relative conormal module with
   `(A/J) ⊗[B] Ω[B/A]`. The image of `J/J²` is `(JB + N²)/N²`: for `b ∈ B`, lift
   `σ(b)` to `a ∈ A`, and for `x ∈ J` use `(b - a)x ∈ N²`.
2. The resulting module is finite projective, hence has a finite projective complement
   making its direct sum finite free. Lift this complement by Tag 07M5 over an étale
   algebra `A₁` with `A₁/JA₁ ≅ A/J`. Base change `B` and the section to `A₁`.
3. Tensor the base-changed algebra with the symmetric algebra of the lifted complement.
   The augmentation defines the extended section. Smoothness follows from Tag 07M6
   and stability under base change and composition. Its relative conormal module is
   the direct sum of the old conormal module and the reduced complement: the positive
   degree augmentation ideal modulo its square is the degree-one module. Reduction
   by the section kernel reduces this module to the lifted complement modulo `J`.
4. This sum is finite free. Choose a finite basis and lift its elements to the kernel.
   The conormal identification sends these lifts to the displayed differential basis.
   The map from `A₁` to `A/J` is the quotient followed by the quotient equivalence,
   hence is surjective. Retain the maps from `B` and to `A/J`; augmentation and base
   change give their required composite. -/
