/-- (blueprint: lem-pc-field-extension-fpqc-cover) For a field extension `K/k`, the
structure map `Spec K ⟶ Spec k` is flat, surjective, and quasi-compact, and its
singleton presieve is an fpqc covering (Stacks, Tags 022B, 03L7, 00HB).

First, `lem-pc-field-extension-flat` gives flatness of the spectrum map, via
`Flat.SpecMap_iff`. Second, `lem-pc-field-extension-surjective` uses the unique
points of the two spectra to give surjectivity. Third,
`lem-pc-field-extension-quasi-compact` observes that the inverse image of the
only nonempty affine open in `Spec k` is the quasi-compact `Spec K`. Finally,
`def-weil-pbc-fpqc-covering` applies: choose `Spec K` over the nonempty affine
open using flatness and surjectivity, and choose no members over the empty open.
These are the clauses of the fpqc covering definition. -/
