/-- The explicitly sheafified and extended bounded finite free complex is strictly perfect.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 068C, affine finite free resolution argument, and Definition 08C4
(blueprint: lem-affine-finite-free-perfect-core).

Proof: In degree `-n`, the extension is canonically isomorphic to the sheafification
of `K.X n`; in positive degrees its terms are zero. A finite free module admits a
finite basis, which identifies it with the finitely supported functions on that
basis. Apply `tildeFinsupp` to identify its associated sheaf with a finite free
structure-sheaf module. Restriction along the affine-chart isomorphism and the
inverse open-site equivalence preserve the unit sheaf and coproducts, hence
preserve these finite free modules. Reindex the finite basis by `ULift (Fin m)`.
The resulting isomorphism gives the required inclusion and projection with
identity composite. For positive degrees use the empty basis. For degrees below
`-r`, the input term is zero by `hzero`, and the additive transport preserves zero
objects. The bounds are `-r` and `0`. This also treats the zero ring, the empty
open, zero-rank terms, and `r = 0`: no basis is required to have positive rank. -/
