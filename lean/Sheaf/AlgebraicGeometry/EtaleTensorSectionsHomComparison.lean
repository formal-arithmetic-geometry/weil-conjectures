/-- Sections of tensor pullbacks and homomorphisms from the pulled-back structure sheaf
are naturally isomorphic as presheaves of sets. No quasi-coherence assumption is needed.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 03DT, proof of Lemma 35.8.1, the reinterpretation of sections
as module maps; Tag 03DR, equation (35.8.0.1).
(blueprint: lem-sc-etale-tensor-sections-hom-comparison).

Proof:
1. For `u : U → X`, compare `tensorPullback u` with Mathlib's `pullback u` by uniqueness
   of left adjoints to `pushforward u`. Use the adjunction selected in
   `exists_tensorPullbackAdjunction` and Mathlib's `pullbackPushforwardAdjunction`.
   The resulting comparison intertwines the two adjunction units.
2. Pullback of the structure sheaf is canonically the structure sheaf of `U`.
   A section of the pullback of `F` corresponds to the module map from that structure
   sheaf sending a local function `a` to `a` times the restricted section. Conversely,
   a module map is recovered from its value at `1`. Transport the target through the
   comparison in step 1 and the source through the structure-sheaf pullback isomorphism.
   These constructions are mutually inverse: linearity determines a map on every
   local function from its value at `1`, and the image of `1` under multiplication by
   the section is the section itself.
3. For `g : V → U` over `X`, pullback of the map in step 2 is multiplication by the
   pulled-back section. The comparison in step 1 respects composition because both
   comparison composites are the unique comparison of left adjoints intertwining
   the composite adjunction units. In particular, `tensorSectionsComp` is exactly the
   composition comparison normalized by those units. The equality `g ≫ u = v` gives
   the same equality transport on both sides. Hence the component bijections commute
   with `etaleTensorSectionsRestriction` and with the maps of `etaleHom`.
4. The component bijections and this naturality assemble into a natural isomorphism.
   This uses neither a covering nor a sheaf condition. -/
