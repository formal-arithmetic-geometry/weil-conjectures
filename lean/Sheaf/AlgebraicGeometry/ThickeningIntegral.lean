/-- Integrality is invariant under a morphism of arbitrary thickenings. No cartesian
or finite order assumption is needed.

Source: Stacks Project, More on Morphisms, Tag 09ZV, part (5).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-thickening-integral).

Proof:
1. Both thickening maps are closed immersions surjective on points, hence universal
   homeomorphisms, separated, affine, integral and universally closed
   (def-sbc-first-order-thickening; lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersion-integral-separated-uc).
   The square identifies the composites `i_X ≫ f'` and `f ≫ i_S`.
2. If `f'` is integral, its composite with `i_X` is integral. Since `i_S` is separated,
   integrality of `f ≫ i_S` implies integrality of `f` by Morphisms Tag 035D (2)
   (lem-weil-pbc-integral-of-comp-separated).
3. Conversely, if `f` is integral, it is affine and universally closed by Morphisms
   Tag 01WM (pqf-lem-integral-univclosed).
4. The composite `f ≫ i_S` is universally closed. It equals `i_X ≫ f'`, and `i_X`
   is surjective, so `f'` is universally closed
   (lem-weil-pbc-image-universally-closed; Mathlib UniversallyClosed.of_comp_surjective).
5. For an affine open `V'` of `S'`, its inverse image `V` under `i_S` is affine since
   `i_S` is affine. Then `f` inverse image of `V` is affine. By the square this is
   the inverse image under `i_X` of `f'` inverse image of `V'`. Restricting `i_X`
   gives a thickening of that affine scheme. Tag 06AD makes `f'` inverse image
   of `V'` affine (lem-weil-pbc-thickening-affine-scheme), proving `f'` affine.
6. An affine universally closed morphism is integral by Tag 01WM. Together with
   step 2 this proves the equivalence. -/
