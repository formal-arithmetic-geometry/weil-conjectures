/-- The canonical affine algebra adjunction component.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 0AVW and 01SB.
(blueprint: new-affine-algebra-module-finite-limits).

Proof: Identify the canonical left adjoint with tensor pullback using the tensor Hom adjunction.
On an
affine open Spec B with inverse image Spec A, the stalk map at p over q is the localization A
localized away from q to A_p, hence flat. Tensor pullback preserves kernels by the exact,
jointly conservative stalk functors. It preserves finite products because tensor preserves
finite direct sums. Kernels and finite products imply preservation of finite limits in an
abelian category. Transport along the unique isomorphism of left adjoints. Empty schemes and
zero modules cause no exceptions.
