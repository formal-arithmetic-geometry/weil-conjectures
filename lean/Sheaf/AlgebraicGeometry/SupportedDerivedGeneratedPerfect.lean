/-! # Building supported derived objects from a perfect complex

Source: Stacks Project, proof of Lemma 48.4.3(3) (Tag 0E4G), using Lemmas 36.15.4
(Tag 0A9A) and 13.37.3 (Tag 09SN)
(blueprint: lem-sc-supported-derived-generated-perfect).

Coproducts are specified by colimiting cofans, so the statement does not require a chosen
coproduct instance. Distinguished triangles are taken in the ambient derived category;
the sequence objects lie in its full quasi-coherent subcategory.

/-- Every quasi-coherent derived object supported off a quasi-compact open is built from
one perfect supported complex by successive cones and a sequential homotopy colimit.
Source: Stacks Project, proof of Lemma 48.4.3(3), Tags 0E4G, 0A9A and 09SN
(blueprint: lem-sc-supported-derived-generated-perfect).

Proof:
1. Apply `lem-pc-supported-perfect-generator` to the closed complement of V to obtain E.
2. Support and quasi-coherence are preserved by shifts and cones, using the long exact
cohomology sequence. Direct sums exist by `lem-pc-derived-qcoh-direct-sums` and agree
with ambient sums; their cohomology is computed by sums by
`lem-pc-derived-ambient-direct-sums`. Thus sums preserve support. By
`lem-pc-perfect-object-compact`, E is compact in the quasi-coherent category and in its
supported full subcategory, whose sums agree. It generates that subcategory in the sense
of `def-pc-generators`.
3. Apply `lem-pc-compact-generators-build-objects` to this singleton compact generating
family. Rotate its transition triangles: their cones are sums of shifts of E, since
shifting such a sum again gives a sum of shifts. Prepend a zero term; its first cone is
the original first term, a sum of shifts of E. Prepending zero leaves the telescope
unchanged. The telescope triangle is precisely the sequential derived colimit asserted.
