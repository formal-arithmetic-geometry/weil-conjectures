-- Comparing section maps elaborates the nested resolution and homology transports.
/-- The base-change map constructed from resolutions is independent of the resolutions
and augmented lifts. Its adjoint sends the canonical image of a class on f⁻¹V to the
canonical image of its pullback along g' restricted to g'⁻¹(f⁻¹V).
The local pullback is written as the recorded cohomology h-map of the restricted unit;
the unit square identifies its target with the restriction of g'^*F.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-flat-base-change-map-sections).

Proof: (1) Injective resolutions exist by lem-weil-pbc-scheme-modules-enough-injectives.
Flat pushforward preserves injectives by
lem-weil-pbc-flat-module-pullback-exact-pushforward-injective, so
lem-weil-pbc-lift-along-injective-quasi-iso supplies t with the prescribed augmentation.
Two such t are homotopic by lem-weil-pbc-lift-to-injective-unique-up-to-homotopy.
The pushforward square is the sectionwise comparison; termwise adjunction preserves
homotopies by lem-weil-pbc-termwise-adjunction-homotopy. Comparison lifts between
resolutions and their homotopy inverses prove the first equality for every choice.
(2) Restrict I and J to U = f⁻¹V and W = g'⁻¹U. Restriction preserves resolutions by
lem-weil-pbc-module-open-restriction-injectives. Restrict the unit sectionwise;
on each open it is m ↦ 1 ⊗ m. The restricted unit square gives psi and the canonical
identification h^*(F|U) ≅ F'|W. These resolutions and the section identifications give
FlatBaseChangeOpenChoices for every V.
(3) Restrict t to U. In def-weil-pbc-module-cohomology-fmap choose a resolution lambda
of h_*(J|W) and comparison lambda times the restricted t.
By lem-weil-pbc-module-pushforward-injectives-sections-quasi-iso, H(Γlambda) is invertible.
Thus H(Γlambda) inverse times H(Γlambda times q_V) is H(q_V), so this is the
recorded cohomology pullback. A cocycle s maps to t(s).
(4) Restrictions commute with t, hence with H(q_V). The canonical theta maps of
lem-weil-pbc-higher-direct-image-presheaf turn these into a presheaf map to
 g_*R^p f'_*F'. Sheafification gives its unique extension.
(5) q = g_*c times the unit. Exactness of g^* identifies the homology of the pulled-back
complex with g^* of its homology. Locally represent a cohomology-sheaf section by a
cocycle s: the adjoint of H(c) takes [s] to [c(unit(s))] = [q(s)]. Therefore it is
that unique extension. Substituting step (3) proves the displayed section formula. -/
