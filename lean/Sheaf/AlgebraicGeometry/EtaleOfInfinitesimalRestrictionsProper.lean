/-- A finite type morphism to a locally Noetherian scheme is étale if all its
infinitesimal restrictions are étale and its source is proper over the complete base.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0GS2, complete Noetherian essential-surjectivity
paragraph, using More on Morphisms, Tag 0A43(2), and Algebra, Tag 05GI(4).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-etale-infinitesimal-restrictions-proper).

Proof:
1. Let j : Y_0 → Y be the projection from Y ×_A Spec(A/I), and J its ideal
   sheaf. This is a closed immersion. On every affine open Spec R of Y,
   J is IR, and the (n+1)st power is I^(n+1)R. Thus the closed subscheme
   cut out by J^(n+1) is canonically Y ×_A Spec(A/I^(n+1)). Under these
   identifications the base changes of g in the hypothesis are exactly
   the infinitesimal neighbourhood restrictions.
2. Apply etale_on_open_of_etale_infinitesimal_neighbourhoods to obtain
   an open W of X containing g^(-1)(Y_0), with g restricted to W étale.
3. Completeness gives I ≤ jacobson(0). For x in X, the image of the
   nonempty closed set closure({x}) under the proper map g ≫ f is closed
   and nonempty. Any nonempty closed subset of Spec A contains a maximal
   ideal m, and every such m contains I. Hence there is t in closure({x})
   mapping to V(I). The image of Y_0 → Y is f^(-1)(V(I)), as follows
   from the affine description Spec(R/IR) above. Thus t lies in W.
4. Since W is open and t is a specialization of x, x also lies in W.
   Therefore W is all of X, and the étaleness of its restriction proves
   Etale g. If X is empty this argument is vacuous and still valid. -/
