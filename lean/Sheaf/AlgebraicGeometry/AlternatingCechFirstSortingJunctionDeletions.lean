/-- The outgoing junction deletions give the successive partial sorting differences.

Source: Stacks 01FM, verification of equation 20.23.6.1 (the computation omitted
in the source), junction terms of the labelled-deletion argument.

Proof: A stable permutation exists uniquely by ordering the finite set of labels
by (value, original position). For every prefix length, the partial permutation
exists uniquely by keeping that prefix and enumerating the unused labels
in their original increasing order. Thus both permutation filters pick one term.
For each stable permutation σ and partial permutation τ with prefix a,
σ a occurs exactly twice in the junction: at a, and at the unique tail position
whose τ-label is σ a. All other labels occur once. Delete the prefix occurrence:
the remaining tuple is t composed with τ, because τ agrees with σ below a.
Its coefficient is sign τ, since the two powers of -1 at a cancel. Delete the
tail occurrence: the remaining permutation fixes σ through a and has an
increasing unused tail, hence is the partial permutation at a+1. If σ a occurs
at position b of τ (junction position b+1), moving it from b to a contributes
(-1)^(b-a); the deletion at b+1 therefore gives minus the sign of this next partial permutation.
Index-map composites agree with the resulting permutation map by comparing
all projections and applying the product universal property. This proves the
difference at each a after summing over the unique partial permutation.
For the final a, both partial permutations are σ, so the two terms cancel.
Stable sorting orders pairs (value, original position), so repeated values do
not change the argument. Empty index types have no tuple t.
