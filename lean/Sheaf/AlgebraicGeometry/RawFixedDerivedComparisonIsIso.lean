/-- Fixed-coefficient raw evaluation is invertible, including empty charts.

(blueprint: lem-sc-raw-fixed-derived-comparison-is-iso).

Proof: The raw derived evaluation is an isomorphism. Its second factor is the
image, under cohomology, of the inverse of the canonical derived composition
isomorphism. A functor preserves isomorphisms, as does composition. -/
