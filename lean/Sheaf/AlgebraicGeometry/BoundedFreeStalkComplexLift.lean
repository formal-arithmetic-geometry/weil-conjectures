/-- Restriction of ordinary direct image from an open recovers the original module.
Source: ordinary module direct image, whose sections on V are sections on V intersect U.
For V contained in U, the projection U intersect V to V is an isomorphism. Applying
M to this projection identifies the restriction of direct image with M. The counit
of restriction/direct image has these maps as components, hence is an isomorphism.
This is the direct-image step of lem-sc-bounded-free-stalk-complex-lift. -/

/-- A bounded free stalk complex lifts as a complex, without a prescribed derived object.

Source: Stacks Project, Tags 0BCD and 0BC7, descent of finite presentations and maps,
and Tag 00CR. The final direct image is only an auxiliary global complex.
(blueprint: lem-sc-bounded-free-stalk-complex-lift).

Proof:
1. Fix bounds a,b. The stalk ring is nonzero, since it is local. A zero free module
   over it has rank zero, so hfree implies d i = 0 outside [a,b], including when b < a.
   Choose bases using hfree, and express the differentials as finite matrices. There
   are only finitely many entries and finitely many equations for the square to vanish.
2. Choose an affine neighbourhood of x. Its stalk is the prime localization of its
   section ring, the filtered colimit of principal localizations (Tag 00CR). Lift all
   entries to one principal neighbourhood. Every entry of each differential composite
   has zero germ; shrink to a common later principal neighbourhood where these finitely
   many entries vanish. Equivalently use the maps and equality clauses of finite
   presentation descent. The rank-d i free modules and these matrices now define a
   bounded free sheaf complex L on this affine open U. Its stalk complex is isomorphic
   to F, since the chosen bases conjugate the differentials to their lifted matrices.
3. Define H by the termwise ordinary direct image along U into X: on an open V its
   sections are the sections of L on V intersect U, with scalars restricted from V.
   Direct image is additive and preserves zero objects, so H is bounded. Its restriction
   to U is L. Neighbourhoods contained in U are cofinal at x, so its stalk complex is
   the stalk complex of L. These identifications give the free-term and stalk isomorphisms.
No comparison with another derived object is made. Empty spectra have no x; rank-zero
terms and empty degree intervals require no entries or equations to lift.
