/-- The differential of an alternating cochain vanishes on tuples with repetitions.
Source: Stacks 01FG, differential stability of alternating cochains before Definition 01FH.

Proof: choose positions a < b with equal entries. Every face deleting a position other
than a or b still has these equal entries, so its value is zero by hz. If the face deleting
a also has a repetition, then so does the face deleting b, since they differ by a
permutation; both remaining terms vanish. Otherwise the two faces differ by the cycle
moving the surviving equal entry past b-a-1 positions. Its sign is (-1)^(b-a-1).
Apply hc to that cycle. The face signs (-1)^a and (-1)^b make the two surviving
coefficients opposite. Both restriction composites agree in the poset of opens, so
the terms cancel. This works with arbitrary abelian groups, including groups with
2-torsion, without deducing vanishing merely from antisymmetry. For p = 0 the two
faces agree and have coefficients 1 and -1; an empty index type has no such tuple.
