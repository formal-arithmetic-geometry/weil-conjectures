/-- For a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme, the full subcategory of complexes with
quasi-coherent cohomology is compactly generated, with its inherited triangulated structure.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 09IS and Tag 09SQ
(blueprint: lem-pc-derived-qcoh-compact-generation).

Proof:
1. By `lem-pc-derived-qcoh-perfect-generation`, perfect complexes generate under shifts,
cones, retracts and arbitrary direct sums.
2. By `lem-pc-perfect-object-compact` and `lem-pc-perfect-complexes-compact-set`, choose
set-indexed representatives of the perfect complexes, all compact. Their coproduct exists
by `lem-pc-derived-qcoh-direct-sums`. If all maps from this coproduct into shifts of K
vanish, all maps from each representative into shifts of K vanish. The objects A such that
Hom(A[m], K) vanishes for all integers m form a strictly full subcategory closed under
shifts, retracts and sums. Closure under cones follows from exactness of Hom out of a
triangle (`lem-weil-pbc-hom-out-of-triangle-exact` (ii)): a map from the cone factors through
the shifted first object and hence is zero. Step 1 makes this subcategory the whole category;
thus the identity of K is zero and K is zero. The coproduct is therefore a weak generator
(`def-pc-generators`).
3. Arbitrary direct sums exist by `lem-pc-derived-qcoh-direct-sums`; the family of Step 2
therefore satisfies `def-pc-compactly-generated`, using `def-pc-compact-object`.
The triangulated structure is inherited from D(O_X), since quasi-coherent cohomology is
stable under shifts and extensions and contains zero. -/
