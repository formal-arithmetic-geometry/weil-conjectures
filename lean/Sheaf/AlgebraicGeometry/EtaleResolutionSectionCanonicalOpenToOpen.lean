/-- Open-to-open restriction identity for a normalized comparison.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 03F3 (2), and Tag 0A50, proof;
the Hom-cocycle expansion of the parent restriction argument.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-etale-resolution-section-canonical-open-to-open)

Proof: Represent the class by a cycle z in the resolution evaluated at B,
using surjectivity of homologyπ in abelian groups. The free-sheaf sections
adjunction identifies the section iCycles q z with a morphism f from the
free sheaf on B to I.cocomplex.X q. Naturality in the coefficient sheaf
and the cycle equation show that f composed with the differential is zero.
Let a be the image of the inclusion A to B under etaleOpenFreeSheaf X.
Naturality of the free-sheaf adjunction identifies a composed with f with
the restriction of the original section. Naturality of homologyπ identifies
the resulting cycle class with the homology map of etaleSectionMap.
Apply c.open_cocycle at A and B. The formula I.mk₀_comp_extMk expresses
the class at A as precomposition of I.extMk f by a. Expand the two
etaleOpenObjectCohomologyMap expressions. Pulling back a along A.ι and
precomposing with the identity generator at A equals pulling back the
identity generator at B along X.homOfLE h, with the constant-sheaf and
inverse-image composition comparisons inserted. This generator equality is already proved by
`etaleOpenFreeSheafUnit_coherence B A h`: its left side contains the
direct pullback followed by the composition comparison, and its right
side contains the constant comparison followed by the pulled-back unit.
Use Ext.mapExactFunctor_comp and Ext.mapExactFunctor_mk₀ to move
precomposition through inverse image. Substitute the generator equality.
Then `Ext.exactFunctorCompositionComparison` for the two inverse-image
functors and upperStarComp replaces the successive Ext pullbacks by the
direct one. Ext associativity and cancellation of the composition
isomorphism give cohomologyMap along X.homOfLE h followed by the inverse
composition comparison, exactly openCohomologyRestriction. Surjectivity
of homologyπ finishes for every class. This argument includes q = 0,
A = B, empty opens, and the zero sheaf. -/
