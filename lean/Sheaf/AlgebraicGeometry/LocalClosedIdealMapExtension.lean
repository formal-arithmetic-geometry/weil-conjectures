/-- A local map from a closed structure module extends after restricting its source
by a nonzero ideal on the integral closed subscheme. No injectivity is assumed or
asserted. Agreement holds on the entire given open, not just on the generic stalk.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01YB (extension from ideal powers), as used in the last
paragraph of Tag 01YE, with the affine closed-pushforward calculation of Tag 01QY.
(blueprint: lem-pc-local-closed-ideal-map-extension)

Proof: let I be the vanishing ideal of the closed complement of U. Mathlib's
support formula identifies its support with that complement. The ambient extension
lemma applies Tag 01YB to H = i_*O_W and G and gives n and chi:I^n H -> G with the
specified equality on U. Define J = (I^n).comap i using actual ideal-sheaf data.
Its support is the inverse image of the support of I^n, which is contained in the
support of I. If J were zero, its support would be all of W, so i(eta) would lie
outside U, contradicting hx. Thus J is nonzero, including when n = 0. The normalized
closed structure ideal-product comparison gives an isomorphism e:i_*J -> I^n H
commuting with the inclusions into H. Set alpha = e.hom followed by chi. Restriction
preserves composition; associativity and the two inclusion equations prove agreement
on the entire U. This also covers a zero local map and U = X; there is no assertion
that alpha is injective. The two bridge lemmas carry the ambient extension and affine
comparison steps separately. No unproved existence theorem supplies the data of J. -/
