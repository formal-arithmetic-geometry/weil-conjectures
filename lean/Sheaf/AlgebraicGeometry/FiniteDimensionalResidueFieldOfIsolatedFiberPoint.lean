/-- An isolated point of a fibre of a locally finite type morphism has finite residue
field extension. Source: Stacks Project, Morphisms, Lemma 01TH, (2) implies (1),
and Lemma 01TG (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-isolated-fibre-point-residue-finite).

Proof:
1. Put `s = f x` and form `f.fiber s` with projections `p` to `X` and `pi` to
   `Spec kappa(s)` (def-pc-scheme-fibre). By lem-weil-pbc-lft-base-change, `pi` is
   locally of finite type. The fibre homeomorphism identifies `x` with the unique
   point `xi = f.asFiber x` over it; its singleton is open by hypothesis.
2. Apply lem-weil-pbc-lft-over-field-isolated-point-residue-finite to this fibre
   over `kappa(s)` and `xi`: `kappa(xi)` is finite over `kappa(s)` through `pi`.
   By lem-weil-pbc-spec-residue-field-identification, the residue field of
   `Spec kappa(s)` at its unique point is `kappa(s)`. The canonical map to `S`
   induces the identity on that residue field, since its stalk map is the residue map.
3. By lem-weil-pbc-fibre-product-point-residue-field, the residue field at `xi`
   is the fraction field of a prime quotient of `kappa(x) tensor kappa(s)` over
   `kappa(s)`. This tensor product is `kappa(x)`, via `a tensor b` mapping to
   `a * f.residueFieldMap x b`. It is a field, so the prime is zero. Thus the
   residue map induced by `p` is an isomorphism `kappa(x) -> kappa(xi)`, compatible
   with the two actions of `kappa(s)` (def-weil-residue-field).
4. Transport finite dimensionality along this `kappa(s)`-linear isomorphism:
   the extension induced by `f` is finite (def-pc-field-extension). -/
