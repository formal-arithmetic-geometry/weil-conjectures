/-- A zero-dimensional finite-type scheme over an algebraically closed field has the
same finite discrete set of points after extension of the ground field.
Source: Stacks Project, algebra.tex, Lemmas 00KH and 00P4, Theorem 00FV;
Schemes Lemma 01JT (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-zero-dimensional-base-change-points).

The proof first obtains finiteness and discreteness from the Artinian zero-dimensional
case, then identifies each residue field with the algebraically closed base field by
Nullstellensatz.  The point description of a fibre product identifies each fibre of the
projection with `Spec k'`; its unique point gives bijectivity.  Dimension zero and
local Artinianness after field extension make the source of the projection discrete, so
this bijection is a homeomorphism. -/
