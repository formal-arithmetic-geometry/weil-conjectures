/-- Two nonzero integral ideals have coherent pushforward and a coherent common generic lattice.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01YH, `lemma-property-irreducible`, proof, the paragraph
beginning "Next, suppose" and its two intersection sequences.
(blueprint: lem-pc-r2-integral-ideals-common-generic-lattice)

Proof: W is locally Noetherian as a closed subscheme of X. The zero ideal has zero
sections on every affine open, hence a zero module; pushforward preserves zero objects.
Thus the hypothesis on i_*I implies I is nonzero. Ideals are quasi-coherent kernels;
coherent submodule closure inside the coherent structure module proves I is coherent.
Construct L = Ker(I.toModules → O_W → (W/J)_*O_(W/J)). Its kernel arrow b_0 is mono.
The composite L → I.toModules → O_W lifts to J.toModules by its kernel universal
property. Call this lift d_0; its composite with the mono J → O_W is the mono
L → I → O_W, so d_0 is mono. L is a quasi-coherent submodule of coherent I,
hence coherent, as is i_*I by closed pushforward. This constructs the intersection
as a kernel, with no arbitrary choice.
Both I and J have full generic stalk by the integral-ideal criterion. Since J → O_W
is surjective there and its composite with O_W → (W/J)_*O_(W/J) is zero, the latter
map is zero at the generic stalk. Kernel-stalk exactness therefore makes b_0 bijective.
The equality d_0 followed by J → O_W = b_0 followed by I → O_W, and bijectivity
of the three other generic maps, make d_0 bijective. Set K = i_*L and push forward
the two maps. Finite pushforward preserves coherence and monomorphisms, and naturality
of closed-pushforward stalk comparison transfers the two generic bijections. The proof
uses no cokernel-support result. Unit ideals and zero cokernels require no separate case;
zero ideals are excluded precisely by the two stated nonzero hypotheses. -/
