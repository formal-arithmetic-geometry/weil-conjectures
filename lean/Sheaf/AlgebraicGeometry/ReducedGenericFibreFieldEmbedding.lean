/-- A dominant generic field map and a compatible finite purely inseparable base
extension induce a dominant field map on the reduced generic pullback.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0559, second proof, reduction and field embedding step.
Proof: both original fibre and reduced pullback fibre are affine. Write C for the original
fibre ring and k for its base field. Scheme-theoretic dominance of j gives an injection
C -> L. Flatness of k'/k preserves this injection after tensoring. Since k'/k is finite
purely inseparable, L tensor_k k' is an Artinian local ring whose reduction is a field.
The compatible maps into E give a unital homomorphism of this tensor ring into E. Its
kernel is its unique prime, hence its nilradical, so its reduced map is injective.
An injective ring map induces an injection on reductions by detection of nilpotence.
Since S' is integral and eta' is generic, its residue field is the localization of
its coordinate ring at zero. Localization commutes with reduction, identifying the reduced
pullback fibre ring with (C tensor_k k')_red. Compose these injections to get its injection
into E. Its spectrum
map is scheme-theoretically dominant and respects the base algebra maps by construction.
Transport the E/k' transcendence basis and separability across e to obtain separable
generation over kappa(eta'). This construction works also for identity base extension;
it imposes no reducedness or finite presentation assumption on the original family.
