/-- Proper pushforward preserves support proper over a separated finite-type base.
Source: Stacks Project, Theorem 088E, the paragraph on the support of H, using
Tags 02O5, 0CYQ (1), and 0CYN (https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/088E).
(blueprint: new-chow-algebraization-support)

Proof: Let C be the closed support of F, proper over S by hF. The image q(C) is
closed and proper over S because f is separated (Tag 0CYQ (1)). Proper coherent
pushforward (Tag 02O5) makes q_*F coherent on the Noetherian Z, hence its support D
is closed. Outside q(C), the preimage of the open complement has only zero stalks
of F. The sheaf axiom implies its sections on every open are zero, so q_*F has
zero stalks outside q(C). Thus D is a closed subset of q(C). Tag 0CYN implies
that D is proper over S, which is precisely the asserted support condition. -/
