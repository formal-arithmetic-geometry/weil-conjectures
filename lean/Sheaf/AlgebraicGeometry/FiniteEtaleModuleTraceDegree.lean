/-- A finite étale map with geometric fibres of cardinality `d` admits a coefficient-linear
trace whose composite with restriction is `d` times the identity. No invertibility of `d`
is assumed, and the coefficients may be any commutative ring.

Source: Stacks Project, Section 03SH (section-trace-method), Definition 03SE
(definition-trace-map), its characterization, and the following degree formula.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-etale-module-trace-degree)

Proof: Choose jointly surjective étale neighbourhoods splitting the finite étale map into
finitely many copies of the neighbourhood (Stacks 04HN). A geometric point of each
nonempty neighbourhood identifies the summands with the lifts of that point, so the
hypothesis makes their number `d`. On these neighbourhoods the pullback/direct-image
adjunction identifies its unit with the diagonal map into the product of the copies of
`G`. Define the trace by adding the coordinates. Each coordinate projection and addition
is coefficient-linear. The sum is invariant under permutations; on overlaps the two
splittings differ locally by permutations, so their sums coincide. The sheaf condition
therefore glues these local maps to a coefficient-linear sheaf morphism. On a splitting
neighbourhood the composite sends a section `s` to the sum of `d` copies of `s`, namely
`d • s`. Equality of morphisms is checked after this jointly surjective covering by sheaf
separatedness, giving the global formula. Empty fibres give the zero sum and the same
formula for `d = 0`; the degree-one case gives the identity. No local constancy, finite
rank, connectedness of the cover, or characteristic assumption is required. -/
