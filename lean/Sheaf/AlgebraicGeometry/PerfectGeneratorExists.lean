/-- For a quasi-compact and quasi-separated scheme, a single perfect complex generates the
quasi-coherent derived category. Source: Stacks Project, Tag 09IS
(blueprint: lem-pc-perfect-generator-exists).

Proof:
1. Apply `lem-pc-supported-perfect-generator` with support equal to all of X. Its
complement is empty and hence quasi-compact. The support conditions are vacuous,
so it gives a perfect quasi-coherent object P and the shifted-Hom detection criterion.
2. P is compact by `lem-pc-perfect-object-compact`. Apply
`lem-sc-supported-derived-generated-perfect-core` with the empty open and this same P.
Its triangulated-closure hypothesis is supplied by step 1; the support conditions again
are vacuous. Each quasi-coherent E has a tower starting at zero, with transition cones
coproducts of shifts of P, and a final telescope triangle with E as its third object.
3. Given an ambient triangulated property Q containing P and closed under Type u
coproducts, shifts of P and their coproducts satisfy Q. Induct on the tower, using
closure under middle terms of triangles. Reindex its countable coproduct by ULift ℕ
in Type u. Both first objects of the telescope triangle then satisfy Q, so E does too.
The additional retract-closure hypothesis is not needed for this argument. -/
