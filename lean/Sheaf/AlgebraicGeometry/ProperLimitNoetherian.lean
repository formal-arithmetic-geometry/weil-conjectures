/-- A proper morphism over a quasi-compact and quasi-separated scheme is a limit of
proper morphisms over schemes of finite type over `ℤ`, with affine transitions.
Source: Stacks limits.tex, Tag 0A0P (proper-limit-of-proper-finite-presentation-noetherian)
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-proper-limit-noetherian).
Proof:
1. Use lem-weil-pbc-proper-closed-in-proper-fp (09ZR) to choose a closed immersion
   X → Y over S with Y → S proper and finitely presented.
2. Apply prop-nagata-noetherian-inverse-system (01ZA) and
   lem-weil-pbc-cofiltered-limit-directed-reindex to approximate S by finite-type
   schemes Sⱼ over ℤ with affine transitions. If S is affine, use the finitely generated
   subrings from lemma-nagata-noetherian-inverse-system-affine instead.
3. Descend Y to a finitely presented Yⱼ₀ → Sⱼ₀ by thm-pd-spreading-out (01ZM).
   Its base changes Yⱼ have affine transition maps and limit Y.
4. Enlarge j₀ using lem-weil-pbc-eventually-proper (081F). All Yⱼ → Sⱼ are now proper
   by lem-weil-pbc-proper-base-change.
5. For j ≥ j₀, take the scheme-theoretic image Zⱼ of X → Yⱼ, using
   lem-weil-pbc-scheme-image-qc-kernel. The closed immersion Zⱼ → Yⱼ makes Zⱼ → Sⱼ
   proper by lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersion-proper.
6. The image ideals are the kernels on affine opens, so transitions Yⱼ' → Yⱼ induce
   unique compatible Zⱼ' → Zⱼ. These are affine: their factorization through
   Zⱼ ×_{Sⱼ} Sⱼ' is a closed immersion by lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersion-from-composite,
   followed by an affine projection. The image factorizations give cones from X and S.
7. On affine opens of Yⱼ₀, write the coordinate ring of X as (B ⊗ R)/𝔞. The rings of
   Zⱼ are (B ⊗ Rⱼ)/ker(B ⊗ Rⱼ → (B ⊗ R)/𝔞). Their filtered colimit is (B ⊗ R)/𝔞:
   injectivity follows from the kernel definition and surjectivity from R = colim Rⱼ.
   By lem-weil-pbc-limit-affine-transition and lem-weil-pbc-spec-colimit-limit these
   local computations identify X with lim Zⱼ, and the local isomorphisms glue.
8. Restricting to j ≥ j₀ preserves the base limit by
   lem-weil-pbc-colimit-initial-full-subcategory. The commuting cone equations identify
   f with the limiting morphism, and all the required properties hold.
9. For affine S = Spec A, the chosen base stages are spectra of finitely generated
   subrings. Their directed union is A; restricting to the cofinal tail preserves this
   colimit (def-weil-pbc-category-colimit). The global-section maps induced by the
   base cone form the colimit cocone, whose vertex is Γ(S) ≅ A. -/
