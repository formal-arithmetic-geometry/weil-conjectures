/-- A generic ideal-sum inclusion with filtered source and smaller-support cokernel.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01YE and Tag 01YF, final generic-point paragraph
(https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01YE).
(blueprint: lem-pc-s3-coherent-generic-filtered-extension)

Proof: give T its reduced induced closed subscheme structure i : Z -> X.
Generic-point uniqueness identifies i(genericPoint Z) with ξ, and Z is integral.
Tag 01YE applied to the generic-annihilation hypothesis constructs a coherent
ideal I on Z, a finite rank r and a mono alpha : i_*(I^r) -> F which is an
isomorphism near ξ. Since ξ belongs to Supp F, its stalk is nonzero; consequently
r is positive and I is nonzero. Closed pushforward preserves coherence and
finite sums. The partial-sum chain of copies of i_*I therefore gives a coherent
integral filtration of A = i_*(I^r), each quotient being i_*I. Set Q to the actual
cokernel of alpha and g to its cokernel projection. Coherent cokernel closure
gives coherence of Q, and the mono alpha makes its cokernel sequence short
exact. Stalk exactness gives Supp Q contained in Supp F = T, while invertibility
near ξ gives Q_xi = 0. Since ξ belongs to T, containment is strict. This proves
the assertions without support induction and without claiming a filtration of F.
There is no zero-support case because a generic point belongs to its closed set. -/
