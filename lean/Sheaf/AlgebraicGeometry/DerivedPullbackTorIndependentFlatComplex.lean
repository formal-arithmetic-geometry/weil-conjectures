/-! # Stalkwise Tor-independence of base-flat complexes

Source: Stacks Project, perfect.tex, Tag 0A1D, proof checking Tag 0DJ8 (1)
(blueprint: lem-pc-derived-pullback-tor-independent-flat-complex).

The localized comparison of the existing base-derived tensor cohomology model is
used without replacing the canonical map by an arbitrary isomorphism. Its target
is the ordinary tensor stalk complex, canonically the stalk of tensor pullback
by `Scheme.Modules.exists_tensorPullback_stalk_iso`, applied degreewise.
The algebra-map equations specify the actual structure maps of the cartesian square.

/-- Base-flat bounded-above quasi-coherent complexes satisfy the stalkwise condition.

Source: Stacks Project, perfect.tex, Tag 0A1D, proof via Tag 0DJ8 (1)
(blueprint: lem-pc-derived-pullback-tor-independent-flat-complex).

Here x', x, t and f(x) are the points of X_T, X, T and S. The equality f(x) = g(t)
is `pullback.condition` evaluated at x'; the four algebra-map equations fix
R -> A, R -> B and A tensor_R B -> C to the scheme-induced maps. The model M
is arbitrary: its universal counit and comparison equations fix the canonical map
H^i(G_x tensor-derived_R B) tensor_(A tensor_R B) C -> H^i(G_x tensor_A C).
The target is canonically H^i(((g')^*G)_{x'}) by the natural stalk-pullback
isomorphism of lem-weil-pbc-module-stalk-pullback. IsIso is invariant under this
canonical target identification and the tensor symmetry used by extendScalars.
The derived-category instances and cohomology model are presentations, not geometric
assumptions; they exist for all the module categories and complexes in question.

Proof, following the node step by step:
1. Each stalk G_x^n is flat over R by flatness over S and quasi-coherence (01U4).
   The stalk complex is bounded above, so lem-pc-module-bounded-flat-kflat makes it
   K-flat over R.
2. Apply lem-pur-derived-change-of-rings on the one-point site to R -> B.
   The identity K-flat resolution computes the derived tensor by Q tensor_R B.
   The model's counit comparison on cohomology is this canonical identification.
3. The natural stalk-pullback identification gives the target Q tensor_A C,
   compatibly with differentials. The canonical map A tensor_R B -> C is a
   localization by the affine description of fibre products. Localization is exact
   (lem-weil-pbc-localization-module-exact), hence commutes with cohomology.
   Tensor associativity identifies (Q tensor_R B) tensor_(A tensor_R B) C
   with Q tensor_A C. The model's localized_eq pins the comparison to this map,
   which is an isomorphism in every integer degree. -/
