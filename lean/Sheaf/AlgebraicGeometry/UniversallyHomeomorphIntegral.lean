/-- A morphism whose every base change is a homeomorphism is an integral, universally
injective, surjective morphism.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 04DF, with Tag 05YU.
Proof: Every base change is closed and injective, so the morphism is universally closed
and universally injective, and it is surjective. Transport an affine open cover of the
source along the underlying homeomorphism. The inverse image of each transported open
is the original affine open. The restricted morphism is surjective and universally
closed, so its target is affine by Tag 05YU. Hence these are matching affine covers.
The affine criterion, local on the target, shows that the original morphism is affine.
An affine universally closed morphism is integral by Tag 01WM.
