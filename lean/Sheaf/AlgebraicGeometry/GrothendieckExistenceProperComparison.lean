/-- A formal module on a nonempty proper scheme compares with a completed coherent module.
The error is killed by a power of an ideal all of whose positive powers are nonzero.
This statement does not assume algebraization on any closed subscheme.
Source: Stacks Project, Proposition 088C, last paragraph, and Lemma 088B.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-proper-existence-comparison).

Proof:
1. Apply Chow's lemma (Tag 0200) to f. Its proper surjective modification q:Y -> X
is an isomorphism on a dense open U. Since X is nonempty, U is nonempty. The immersion
of Y into finite projective space is closed: its composite to Spec A is proper and
projective space is separated over Spec A. The finite-coordinate embedding theorem
puts Y in standard projective space, including an empty homogeneous index set.
2. Let K be the radical ideal of the reduced complement X minus U. Its support is that
complement. For every e >= 1 the support of K^e equals the support of K, and misses U.
The zero ideal has support all of X, so K^e is nonzero. This includes U = X: K is then
the unit ideal, whose powers are nonzero on a nonempty scheme.
3. Pull M back along q using formal-systems pullback (Tag 0887). Projective existence
(Tag 0885) gives a coherent F on Y and an isomorphism q^*M to its completion. The ideal
on Y is the extension of I along q followed by f, by functoriality of ideal comap.
The pullback functor's inclusion equation gives the same isomorphism in the ambient
inverse-system category, as required by the push-pull theorem.
4. Apply formal-systems push-pull (Tag 088B) to q, K, F and that isomorphism. It gives
coherence of H = q_*F, a map alpha:M -> H-completion, and a positive exponent t killing
the kernel and cokernel. Kernel forks, cokernel coforks and their universal properties
are exactly those furnished by that theorem. Together with step 2 these are the claim. -/
