/-- A closed-fibre cover descends to a proper scheme over a finite-type integer ring.
No henselian hypothesis or henselization is used in this statement.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0GS2, proof, General case, before henselizing the stages.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-etale-finite-type-closed-fibre-stage).

Proof:
1. Apply proper Noetherian approximation (Tag 0A0P) with affine bases. Write their
   rings as R_i, with maps alpha_i to A, and put K_i = alpha_i^{-1}(I).
2. The quotient rings R_i/K_i have colimit A/I: every element has a representative
   at some stage, and a representative is zero precisely when it lies in K_i.
3. Spec turns this colimit into a limit. Pullbacks commute with limits, so the
   closed fibres X_i,0 form an inverse system with limit Y_0. Their transitions
   are affine: factor each into a closed immersion and a base change of an affine
   transition. Each closed fibre is quasi-compact and quasi-separated by properness.
4. V is of finite presentation (finite and étale), so Tag 01ZM descends it to a
   finitely presented morphism at a stage. Tags 01ZO and 07RP give later stages
   where it is finite and étale. Choose a common upper bound and base change.
5. Use the limit projections p and q. Their first projections commute by the
   original limit-cone relation, and their second projections commute by the
   quotient ring maps. The descended cover pulls back to V over Y_0. -/
