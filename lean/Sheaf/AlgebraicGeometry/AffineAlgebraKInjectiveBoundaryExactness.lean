/-- After affine direct image, cycle sections with zero homology class are
locally boundaries of the section complex.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0AVW, the cohomology calculation in its proof;
Tag 08D4, parts (1) and (2), with bound one.
(blueprint: new-affine-algebra-kinjective-boundary-exactness).

Proof: Fix an affine open V of Y and set U = f⁻¹V, also affine. Restriction
preserves quasi-coherence. Restriction also preserves K-injectivity, since it
is right adjoint to exact extension by zero (Tag 08BS). Thus I restricted to U
computes derived sections on U. Positive module cohomology on U vanishes by affine
vanishing. Sections on U commute with countable products. For E = Q(I), let
A = τ≤n I and B = τ≥n A, with canonical chain maps A → I and A → B.
B is H^n(I) placed in degree n. Derived sections of A → I induce an isomorphism
on H^n by left exactness (the complementary upper tail starts in degree n+1).
The lower tail τ≤(n-1)I has quasi-coherent cohomology and derived sections zero
in degrees n and n+1 by Tag 08D4 with N = 1. Its truncation triangle makes
H^n(RΓ(A)) → H^n(RΓ(B)) invertible. Bottom derived sections of B are Γ(U,H^n(I)).
Use the natural map from sections of a complex to its derived sections. It is
invertible on cohomology for I because I is K-injective. This does not require
its individual terms to be injective: a comparison to a K-injective resolution
is a homotopy equivalence, preserved by sections. Sections preserve kernels,
so H^n(Γ(A)) → H^n(Γ(I)) is invertible as well. Naturality for A → I now shows
that H^n(Γ(A)) → H^n(RΓ(A)) is invertible. Naturality for A → B identifies the
resulting isomorphism H^n(Γ(I)) → Γ(U,H^n(I)) with the raw cycle-class map:
A^n is the kernel of d^n and (A → B)^n is its homology quotient. This verifies
the identity of the map, rather than just existence of an unrelated isomorphism.
The chosen homology data identifies its K and π with these cycles and class map.
Injectivity of that isomorphism says that a cycle with zero homology-sheaf
class is zero in H^n(Γ(I)), so it is the differential of a degree-(n-1) section.
Thus on every affine open the kernel of the pushed π is the image of the pushed
f', the differential into cycles. The reverse inclusion is f' ≫ π = 0.
Equalities of kernels and images on this basis give exactness of the displayed
short complex of f_*O_X-module sheaves. All maps respect the scalar action and
restriction maps since they come from I. Zero complexes, empty opens and all
integer degrees are included; no boundedness of I is imposed. -/
