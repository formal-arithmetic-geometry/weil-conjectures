/-- The diagonal of a smooth morphism of pure relative dimension `d`, when it is closed,
has on an affine neighbourhood of every point either the unit ideal or an ideal generated
by a regular sequence of length `d`. The ideal is the kernel of the map on sections.

(blueprint: lem-sc-smooth-diagonal-regular-immersion).

Proof: outside the closed diagonal image choose an affine neighbourhood in its complement;
the inverse image is empty, so the kernel is the unit ideal. At an image point, if `d = 0`,
the morphism is etale (def-sbc-smooth-morphisms), hence unramified (def-weil-etale-morphism),
and its diagonal is open (def-weil-unramified-morphism). Choose the affine neighbourhood
inside the open and closed image. The diagonal there is an isomorphism, its ideal is zero,
and the empty sequence is regular. If `d > 0`, choose standard smooth affine charts around
the source point (lem-sc-standard-smooth-local-relative-dimension). Their fibre product is
an open neighbourhood of the diagonal point, and the diagonal restricts to the affine
diagonal on that product. The standard smooth affine calculation supplies regular generators
of length `d` on an affine neighbourhood (lem-sc-standard-smooth-affine-diagonal-generators).
This neighbourhood and its ideal also give the required neighbourhood in the original
fibre product. -/
