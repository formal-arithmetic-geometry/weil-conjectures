/-- The fraction formula detects basic-open membership at a point outside the base locus.
Only this point must have a nonvanishing positive-degree section; no global cover is assumed.

Proof: Work in the residue field at x, trivializing L near x. If f(x) is in D_+(s), choose
by hx a nonvanishing section t of degree e. Apply the fraction identity on this chart with
numerator t^d and denominator s^e. If s vanished at x, its e-th tensor power would vanish,
whereas the d-th power of t would not; the identity is a contradiction. Thus s does not
vanish. Conversely, suppose s is nonvanishing at x. Choose a positive-degree homogeneous
t with f(x) in D_+(t), possible because these opens cover Proj. The identity with numerator
s^e and denominator t^d first implies that t is nonvanishing at x, and then that the
pullback of s^e/t^d has nonzero residue. A scheme morphism induces a local homomorphism on
stalks, so this chart function is a unit at f(x). Its basic open in D_+(t) is exactly
D_+(s) intersect D_+(t), proving f(x) is in D_+(s). Positive powers preserve nonvanishing
in a one-dimensional residue-field fibre, which justifies both power tests. The argument
is pointwise and is vacuous for the empty scheme; a zero section gives both sides false. -/
