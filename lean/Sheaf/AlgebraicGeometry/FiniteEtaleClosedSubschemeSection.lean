(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-gabber-finite-etale-section).

An affine étale scheme over a closed subscheme of an affine integral normal scheme with
separably closed function field is a finite disjoint union of opens of the closed subscheme.
If the étale morphism is also finite and surjective, it admits a section.

Proof:
1. Write `X = Spec R`. The closed immersion makes `Z = Spec (R/I)`, and the affine scheme
   `V` corresponds to an étale `R/I`-algebra. Use
   [lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersion-affine-cover-criterion],
   [lem-weil-pbc-morphism-into-affine-scheme], and
   [lem-weil-pbc-etale-ring-map-iff-etale-affine].
2. Lift that algebra to an étale `R`-algebra by [lem-exc-etale-algebra-lift] (Stacks 04D1).
   Its spectrum `U` satisfies `U ×_X Z ≅ V` over `Z`, by
   [lem-weil-pbc-fibre-product-affine-spectra] and
   [lem-weil-pbc-tensor-quotient-base-change].
3. The affine morphism `U → X` is separated by
   [lem-weil-pbc-morphism-affine-schemes-affine] and
   [lem-weil-pbc-affine-morphism-permanence]. Apply [sbc-lem-etale-over-normal] (09Z9)
   to obtain disjoint nonempty opens of `U`, each mapping to `X` by an open immersion.
   Quasi-compactness [lem-weil-pbc-spec-basic-opens-unit-ideal-quasi-compact] makes their
   number finite; each is closed because its complement is the union of the others.
4. Pull these opens back to `U ×_X Z` and transport them to `V`. They remain disjoint,
   clopen, and covering. Each restriction to `Z` is an open immersion by
   [lem-weil-pbc-open-fibre-product] and [lem-weil-pbc-open-immersion-base-change].
5. If `p` is finite and surjective, apply [lem-weil-pbc-clopen-open-cover-section].
   Its proof forms the clopen strata in `Z` determined by membership in the finitely
   many images of these opens. Each stratum lies in one image; use the inverse of that
   open immersion there and glue the resulting sections across the disjoint strata.
