/-- For a finite morphism, the geometric lifts are finite and restriction of germs
identifies the stalk of the direct image of a set sheaf with the product of its stalks.
The component `colimit.pre` takes a germ at `(V, v)` to the germ of the same section at
`(V ×_Y X, (v, x))`, using `Etale.baseChangeNbhd`.

Source: Stacks Project, Proposition 59.55.2, Tag 03QP (1), first display
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-sets-finite-pushforward-stalk).

Proof (the node's ten steps):
1. Form the strict henselization C at y, its closed geometric point, and X^sh over C
   (`def-weil-pbc-strict-henselization-limit`,
   `lem-weil-pbc-strict-henselization-functoriality`). Pull H back to G on X^sh
   (`lem-weil-pbc-sets-etale-inverse-image-composition-units`).
2. The stalk of f_*H is G(X^sh), compatibly with germs, by
   `lem-weil-pbc-sets-pushforward-stalk-strict-henselization` (finite implies qcqs).
3. Finite base change is finite and affine, so X^sh = Spec B for B finite over C
   (`lem-weil-pbc-finite-morphism-permanence`, `def-weil-finite-integral-morphism`).
4. Decompose B into finitely many henselian local factors; their residue fields are
   finite extensions of the separably closed residue field of C, hence separably closed
   (`lem-weil-pbc-finite-over-henselian-local-product`,
   `lem-weil-pbc-sepclosed-finite-extension-unique-embedding`).
5. The factors yield disjoint clopen opens U_i = Spec B_i covering X^sh
   (`lem-weil-pbc-spec-clopen-idempotent`, `def-weil-affine-spectrum`).
6. Pullback identifies lifts of y with lifts of its closed point to X^sh. Each B_i
   has exactly one C-map to Ω, by the unique-embedding lemma of step 4. Thus the lifts
   are indexed by these finitely many factors (`def-pc-fibre-product`).
7. The sheaf condition for the disjoint étale cover U_i gives
   G(X^sh) = product G(U_i). Empty intersections have singleton sections, including
   the empty-family case (`lem-weil-pbc-open-immersion-etale`,
   `lem-weil-pbc-open-fibre-product`, `def-weil-pbc-etale-sheaf-of-sets`).
8. The germ map on each strictly henselian local U_i is bijective
   (`lem-weil-pbc-sets-strictly-henselian-open-sections-stalk`).
9. Inverse-image stalks identify G at each lifted point with H at the corresponding
   point of X (`lem-weil-pbc-sets-etale-inverse-image-stalk-germ`).
10. On a representative section over V ×_Y X, this composite takes exactly the germ
    at (v, x), since restriction does not change germs
    (`def-weil-pbc-geometric-stalks`, `def-weil-pbc-category-colimit`). Reindex by
    the bijection of step 6 to obtain the asserted restriction map. -/
