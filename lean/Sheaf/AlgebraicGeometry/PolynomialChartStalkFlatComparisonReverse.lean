/-- Flatness of the canonical closed-fibre map lifts to the chart stalk map.

The proof applies the local criterion for flatness to the stalk tower. The chart
stalk is essentially finitely presented over the base stalk, is flat over the
base by flatness of the source, and its closed-fibre module is flat precisely
when the canonical polynomial fibre map is flat. The fibre and stalk
identifications transport the resulting flatness.
