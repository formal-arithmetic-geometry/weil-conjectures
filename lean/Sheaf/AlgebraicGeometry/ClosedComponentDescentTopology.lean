/-- If finitely many upstairs components descend to closed subsets under a continuous
surjection, inverse images of downstairs components are upstairs components.

Source: the maximality argument following finite descent in Stacks Project, Tag 054R;
the finite closed-cover criterion is Mathlib's `isIrreducible_iff_sUnion_isClosed`.
Proof: the images of upstairs components form a finite closed cover downstairs. Each image
is irreducible by continuity. An irreducible component downstairs lies in one member of
this cover, and maximality makes them equal. Its inverse image is the upstairs component,
since each upstairs component is the inverse image of a downstairs subset and the map is
surjective. Empty spaces cause no exception, since there are then no downstairs components.
