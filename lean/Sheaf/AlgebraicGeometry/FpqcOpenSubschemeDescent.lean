/-- Compatible open subschemes descend uniquely along an fpqc covering.

Source: literature/stacks-project/descent.tex, Lemma Tag 03N0.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-open-subscheme-fpqc-descent).

Proof:
1. By the fibre-product point description (`lem-weil-pbc-fibre-product-points`),
   compatibility implies that the subset W = ⋃ i, g i (W i) has inverse image W i
   under every g i. Joint surjectivity from `def-weil-pbc-fpqc-covering` makes
   this subset unique.
2. Openness is local on the base: restrict the family and the opens over an
   arbitrary affine open U of S.
3. Choose a finite standard fpqc refinement over U using
   `lem-weil-pbc-fpqc-affine-standard-refinement`. Each refinement member has
   open inverse image of W, since it factors through a T i and pulls back W i.
4. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-standard-fpqc-quotient-topology` to that standard cover
   to conclude W is open on U. Hence W is open on S.
5. Joint surjectivity uniquely determines its underlying subset; an open
   subscheme is determined by that subset with the restricted structure sheaf.
