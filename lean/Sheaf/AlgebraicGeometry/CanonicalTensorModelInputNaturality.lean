/-- The canonical tensor model map commutes with a chain map in its first variable.
Source: Stacks Project, cohomology.tex, Tag 06YH (derived tensor construction), and
Tag 08DJ (representative tensor-Hom comparison).
(blueprint: lem-pc-tensor-model-input-naturality).

Proof: The map pullbackTensorModelMap is the lax monoidal structure map μ of Q,
using the shared sheaf tensor, total-complex tensor, and derived tensor instances.
Apply Functor.LaxMonoidal.μ_natural to f and the identity of L. Q preserves the
identity, and the tensor of chain maps is mapBifunctorMap f (identity L) by the
definition of HomologicalComplex.tensorHom. These substitutions give exactly the
stated equation. Match the local monoidal instances to the instances used in the
definition of pullbackTensorModelMap; its auxiliary additivity, flat resolution,
Grothendieck and colimit proofs are propositions, hence proof irrelevant. The
statement requires no K-flatness: invertibility of μ is not used. It holds for zero
maps, zero complexes and identity maps, directly by lax monoidal naturality. -/
