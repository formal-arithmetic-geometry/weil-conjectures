/-- If a finite intermediate subalgebra has conductor exponent `r`, every element of
`(J(B)A)^r` multiplied by an element of `A` comes from `B`. The explicit hypothesis
`hconductor` states the base ideal power conductor property. The proof extends it
to the mapped ideal by span induction.

(blueprint: semilocal-dim-one-conductor-power-mul)

Source: literature/stacks-project/varieties.tex, Varieties Lemma 09N2.

Proof: rewrite the mapped ideal power as the map of the base ideal power. Induct on
membership in the span defining that map. The conductor hypothesis handles a mapped
base element; zero and sums are preserved by the algebra map. For a scalar multiple,
absorb the scalar into the multiplier in A and commute the factors.

The original statement was false without `hconductor`: r = 0 and z = 1 would force
A to equal the image of B. This explicit conductor hypothesis is retained from the
finite conductor theorem at the caller.

/- STATEMENT-DISPUTED: the original statement omitted the conductor property for r.
At r = 0 and z = 1 it would force every element of A to come from B.
The corrected statement below makes the source's suitable-exponent condition explicit. -/
