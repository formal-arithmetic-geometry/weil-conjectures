/-- Every set-valued sheaf on the small etale site of an algebraically closed field
is canonically constant, and its global sections identify with its identity geometric stalk.
Source: Stacks Project, Remark 59.23.2 (Tag 03P5), together with Lemma 59.39.3 (Tag 0A3H).
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-spec-algebraically-closed-etale-sheaf-constant).

Proof:
1. Every etale object over `Spec Ω` is a coproduct of copies of `Spec Ω`, by
   `lem-weil-pbc-etale-fibre-discrete-separable-points` and algebraic closedness.
2. The sheaf equalizer condition computes sections on such a coproduct as the product
   of its sections on the one-point pieces, including the empty coproduct.
3. The constant sheaf has the same product description by
   `lem-weil-pbc-constant-sheaf-set-sections-connected-natural`; hence the canonical
   counit of `constantSheafAdj` is an isomorphism, naturally in the sheaf.
4. A pointed etale neighbourhood has a unique morphism from the identity neighbourhood,
   namely its specified lift. Thus the identity neighbourhood is initial in the pointed
   category and terminal in its opposite, which indexes the stalk colimit. The displayed
   map is its colimit coprojection: the germ of a global section, hence a bijection.
   Naturality follows from the counit and `toPresheafFiberNatTrans`.
