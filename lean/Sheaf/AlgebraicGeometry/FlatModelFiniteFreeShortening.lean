/-- A bounded nonnegative flat complex with a bounded-above finite-free resolution has,
near a specified point, a finite-free replacement in the same degree interval. The
replacement computes the homology of every ordinary scheme pullback of the flat complex.
This is a general algebraic shortening lemma and has no proper morphism or direct image.

(the flat opcycles criterion and finite-projective local freeness).
Proof:
1. Work on an affine neighbourhood inside `U`. The bounded flat complex `C` has Tor
   amplitude `[0,d]`. Its bounded-above free resolution `Q` is K-flat, so the resolution
   computes tensor with every module, and all negative tensor cohomology vanishes.
2. Set `M = coker(Q^{-1} -> Q^0)`. The negative part of `Q` resolves `M`, since `C`
   has no negative cohomology. The negative tensor vanishing shows that `M` is flat;
   it is finitely presented because `Q^{-1}` and `Q^0` are finite free. Hence `M` is
   finite projective, and is free on an open neighbourhood of the chosen point.
3. Replace the negative tail and degree zero by `M` in degree zero and keep degrees
   `1,...,d`. This quotient complex is quasi-isomorphic to `Q`. On the chosen smaller
   open its degree-zero term and all higher terms are finite free, and it is zero
   outside `[0,d]`. Thus it gives `P` with the stated three structural properties.
4. Both `C` and `P` are bounded flat complexes. Their quasi-isomorphism in the derived
   category is preserved by derived pullback, which ordinary pullback computes for
   such complexes. Taking cohomology gives the isomorphisms for every `g` and `q`.
   Express the smaller neighbourhood as `V <= U` in the ambient scheme to use
   `T.homOfLE hVU` as its open inclusion. No global triviality is claimed.
