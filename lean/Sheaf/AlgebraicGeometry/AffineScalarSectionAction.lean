/-- Affine sheafification and ordinary direct image carry multiplication by `a` to
multiplication by `a` on sections over the affine open, for every section.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01HV, Lemma 26.5.4 (7), Tag 01IB, and Tag 0098.
(blueprint: lem-sc-affine-scalar-section-action).

Proof: On Spec Gamma(X,U), tilde of multiplication by a multiplies local sections by
its image in the structure sheaf: on every basic open this follows from linearity
of localization and the defining localization map of tilde; equality on the basic
opens gives equality on arbitrary opens by the sheaf condition. Restriction along
hU.isoSpec.hom transports this action by its structure-ring map. At the top open
of U this map carries the canonical section of a back to a, since
isoSpec_hom_appTop is GammaSpecIso.hom followed by U.topIso.inv. The inverse over
equivalence evaluates at the open of U corresponding to the object U times U
of the slice site. Its structure-ring comparison and pushforwardOver restrict a
along the second projection, exactly the scalar action on the pushed-forward
sections over U. Thus the resulting map sends every section m to a times m.
This argument includes a = 0 and a = 1; on the empty affine open all section
modules are zero, and no point hypothesis is required. -/
