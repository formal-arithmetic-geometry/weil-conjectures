/-- Every point of the generic fibre lies in the union of the interiors of the strata.
Source: smooth purity blueprint, `sk-prop-sf-cbc`, proof paragraphs 1--3 of
`lem-weil-pbc-finite-pushforward-generic-constructible`.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-generic-fiber-stratum-interiors).

Proof: The finite source is Noetherian. Let C be an irreducible component
containing a point x of the generic fibre, and c its generic point. Continuity
makes g(c) specialize to the generic point of S, and that generic point specializes
to every point of S; since S is T0, g(c) is the generic point. A finite morphism has
discrete fibres, so c specializes to x within a discrete subspace and hence c = x.
Every irreducible component of a Noetherian space contains a nonempty open O of the
whole space (remove all the other finitely many components). The generic point x
lies in O. Choose the stratum T_i containing x. Its closure
contains C, and its coborder is open because the stratum is locally closed.
Thus O intersect coborder(T_i) is an open neighbourhood of x contained in T_i,
so x lies in the interior of that stratum and hence in W.
This works without reducing Z and covers the empty generic fibre vacuously. -/
