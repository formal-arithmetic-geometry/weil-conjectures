/-- The stalk of a locally strictly perfect object is pseudo-coherent, and any finite-free
representative of it computes the derived residue fibre.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0BCD, local-ring paragraph; Tags 08EB and 06YB.
(blueprint: lem-sc-strict-perfect-stalk-fiber-data).

Proof:
1. Choose the strictly perfect representative P on V from hlocal. Restriction to V
   followed by its stalk at x agrees with taking the stalk on X, since neighbourhoods
   contained in V are cofinal. Stalks are exact, hence preserve quasi-isomorphisms and
   derived isomorphisms. Apply this to eG and the comparison of P with E restricted to V.
2. The stalk of a rank-m free sheaf is the free stalk module of rank m. Apply stalks to
   the retractions in IsStrictlyPerfect: the terms of the resulting bounded complex
   are finite projective over the local ring O_X,x, hence finite free. Its bounds are
   preserved because stalks preserve zero objects. This gives hK.
3. The finite-free representative chosen by hK is bounded above, hence K-flat. Termwise
   extension along O_X,x -> kappa(x) computes its derived residue tensor product.
   Resolve G by a K-flat sheaf complex. Its stalk is K-flat, and the tensor-pullback
   stalk formula identifies its residue pullback with residue extension of its stalk.
   Sections on the one-point residue spectrum are exact. Derived invariance of
   residue tensor therefore identifies the chosen model's degree-i homology with
   derivedFiberCohomology X E i x. This identification is linear over
   kappa(x) = IsLocalRing.ResidueField O_X,x. Transport hfin across the linear
   isomorphism, and use invariance of finrank to obtain the displayed equality.
The computation concerns every bounded-above finite-free representative of the same
derived object: K-flatness makes residue cohomology invariant under its derived comparison.
It therefore applies to Classical.choose hK. No rank-minimal model is constructed here.
