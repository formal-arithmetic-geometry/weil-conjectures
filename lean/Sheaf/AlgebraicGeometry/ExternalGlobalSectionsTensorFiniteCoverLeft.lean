/-- Bijectivity descends from a finite cover of the first factor and its overlaps.
There are no quasi-coherence, compactness, or affine-diagonal assumptions in this lemma.

Proof: For an open V of X, the cartesian open-immersion square identifies V times Y
with the inverse image of V under pr_1 : X times Y -> X. The canonical open-immersion
pullback/restriction comparison and the composition comparisons for tensor pullback
identify the external coefficient on V times Y with the restriction of the original
external coefficient. The unit equations for these comparisons and the pure tensor
formula for pullback of a tensor show that restricting an external product is the
external product of the restricted first section and the same second section.
Tensor induction gives this compatibility for all tensors and for every overlap.
Put N = Gamma(Y,G), as a k-vector space. The sheaf equalizer for F on the finite cover U
identifies Gamma(X,F) with the kernel of the difference of the two restriction maps
from the product of F(U_i) to the product of F(U_i intersect U_j). Tensoring with N
preserves this kernel because N is flat over the field. It also preserves the two
products because their indexing sets are finite. The sheaf equalizer for the external
coefficient on the inverse-image cover identifies its global sections with the
corresponding kernel. The restriction compatibility above gives a commuting diagram
of the two kernel diagrams. The hypotheses make the middle and right vertical maps
bijective. The inverse middle map preserves the kernels, since the right vertical
map is injective and the diagram commutes. Thus the middle map restricts to a
bijection of kernels, whose forward map is the displayed canonical external map.
If the indexing type is empty, hcover forces X to be empty; the section modules and
both equalizers are zero. Empty overlaps, empty Y, and zero coefficients are also
covered by the same kernel and finite-product argument. No infinite-product or
positive-cohomology comparison is used. -/
