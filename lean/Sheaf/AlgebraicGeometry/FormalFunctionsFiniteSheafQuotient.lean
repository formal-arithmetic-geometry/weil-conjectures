/-- The finite fibre immersion is closed, and its direct image of the pulled-back module
is the quotient of the local pullback by the corresponding power of the extended ideal.
The quotient equation specifies the isomorphism uniquely, since the quotient projection
is an epimorphism. No cohomology or transition compatibility is asserted here.

Proof: Paste the two base-change squares to identify the finite fibre over the local
base change with the pullback of Spec(A/m^(n+1)) into Spec(A). This is a closed immersion.
The quotient-base-change ideal computation identifies its kernel with the extension of
m^(n+1). Extension commutes with products, so this is the (n+1)-st power of J.
On each affine open, the sheaf power inclusion in formalModuleQuotient is the inclusion
of this ideal power; hence its product with F' is the kernel of the closed-immersion
unit. Apply closedImmersion_unit_quotient to obtain the cokernel isomorphism. Identify
the iterated tensor pullback of F with its pullback to the finite fibre by uniqueness
of left adjoints. The adjunction-unit equation identifies the composite unit with
formalFunctionsFiniteFMap. The cokernel universal property gives the displayed equation;
the epimorphism property of its projection also gives uniqueness. The argument works
for every module, including the zero module, and every n, including n = 0. -/
