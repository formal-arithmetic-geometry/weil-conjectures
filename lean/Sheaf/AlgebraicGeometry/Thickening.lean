# Thickenings of schemes

Source: Stacks Project, More on Morphisms, Definition 37.2.1 (Tag 04EX),
and Definition 37.11.1 (Tag 02H0) (blueprint: def-sbc-first-order-thickening).

For any of the predicates below, a thickening over `S` additionally has
`[T.Over S]`, `[T'.Over S]`, and `[i.IsOver S]`. A thickening of affine
schemes additionally has `[IsAffine T]` and `[IsAffine T']`.
