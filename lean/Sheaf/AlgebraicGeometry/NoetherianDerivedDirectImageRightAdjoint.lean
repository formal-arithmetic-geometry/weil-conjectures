/-- Derived direct image between Noetherian schemes preserves quasi-coherent cohomology,
and its restriction to the full quasi-coherent derived subcategories has a right adjoint.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 0A9E and 08D5 (1)
(blueprint: lem-pc-noetherian-derived-direct-image-right-adjoint).

Proof:
1. Noetherian schemes are quasi-compact by hypothesis and quasi-separated by
   `lem-weil-pbc-locally-noetherian-quasi-separated` (Tag 01OY).
2. By `lem-weil-pbc-qcqs-morphism-permanence`, the morphism is quasi-compact and
   quasi-separated.
3. Apply `schemeDerivedDirectImage_qcqs_hasRightAdjoint` (Tag 0A9E) to obtain
   preservation of quasi-coherent cohomology and a right adjoint to the restriction.
   Its proof packages the preservation and Brown-representability argument.
4. Restrict its preservation witness to full-subcategory objects using `E.obj` and
   `E.property`; its adjoint witness then has the required type definitionally.
