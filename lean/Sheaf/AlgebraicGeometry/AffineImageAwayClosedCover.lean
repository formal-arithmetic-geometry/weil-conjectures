/-- An affine open in one member of a closed cover, disjoint from the other member,
has affine open image in the reduced ambient scheme.

Source: Stacks Project, Varieties, Lemma 09NX, final paragraph.
(blueprint: lem-sc-affine-image-away-closed-cover).

Proof: let W be the complement of T. Restrict f to W. This is a closed immersion
surjective onto W, since the two closed subsets cover X. W is reduced, so the
restricted closed immersion is an isomorphism. As V avoids T, V is contained in
the preimage of W; the composite V -> f^-1 W -> W -> X is therefore an open
immersion. Its source is affine. Its open image is the desired affine open U,
and its set of points is f(V). Empty V and empty W cause no exception. -/
