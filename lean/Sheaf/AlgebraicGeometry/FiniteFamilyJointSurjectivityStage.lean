/-- A finite family of locally finitely presented maps between finite-presentation
models, jointly surjective after pullback to the limit, is jointly surjective at
all sufficiently late stages. This is independent of diagrams, their comparison
isomorphisms, and étaleness of the arrows.

Source: Stacks Project, Limits, Tag 07RR in Situation 081D;
steps 5--6 of lem-weil-pbc-etale-finite-data-descent.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-family-joint-surjectivity-stage).

Proof:
1. Form the finite coproduct W of the sources, with its induced structure morphism
   to the stage. Construct l_b : U_b ⟶ W and g : W ⟶ V using coprojections and
   Sigma.desc; l_b ≫ g = f_b. Finite presentation of the structure morphisms makes
   each U_b and V qcqs. finite_coproduct_lfp_qcqs makes W qcqs and g locally of
   finite presentation.
2. Apply Over.pullback to l_b ≫ g = f_b. Every point lift in the hypothesis gives
   a point lift for the pulled-back g by composition with the pulled-back l_b.
   Apply exists_surjective_of_isLimit (07RR) to g, obtaining a surjective g at i₁.
3. Scheme.Pullback.range_map identifies the image of each pulled-back g with the
   inverse image of its original image under the target first projection. A point
   of V at any later stage j maps to a point at i₁ by the canonical pullback.map;
   their first projections agree. Surjectivity at i₁ therefore implies image
   membership at j and a point lift y under g_j.
4. Project y to W and use sigmaOpenCover to find a summand containing that point.
   Apply the pullback image formula to l_b to lift y itself to the pulled-back U_b.
   Functoriality of l_b ≫ g = f_b gives the desired family lift. This does not assume
   that a point of a scheme pullback is determined by its two projected points.
   For an empty family the coproduct is empty; the same argument forces eventual
   emptiness of the target. -/
