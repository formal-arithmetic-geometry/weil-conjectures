/-- A section on a quasi-compact etale object which vanishes in a filtered sheaf
colimit vanishes at a later stage. Quasi-separatedness is not needed for this assertion.
Source: Stacks Project, Sites, Lemma Tag 0738, proof of part (2), and Etale
Cohomology, Section Tag 03Q4 (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-etale-section-colimit-eventual-zero).

Proof: Form the sectionwise presheaf colimit P of G and identify its sheafification
with c.pt, including the coprojections, by the sheafification adjunction for modules.
The image of s in P has zero image after sheafification, so local equality supplies
an etale covering of U on which it is zero in P. The covering arrows are etale
by etale cancellation, hence their images are open. Compactness of U gives a finite
subfamily still covering U. On each member, the filtered-colimit equality criterion
supplies an arrow out of i killing the restriction of s. Filteredness supplies one
common target and equalizes the finitely many arrows from i. At that target, the
transport of s restricts to zero on every member of the finite covering. Since that
stage is a sheaf, separatedness implies that the transport of s is zero over U.
For an empty covering the same conclusion follows from the sheaf condition, which
makes the sections on the empty object a zero module. -/
