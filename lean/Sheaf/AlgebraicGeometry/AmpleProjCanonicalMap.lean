/-- The canonical morphism to the Proj of the section ring, with its inverse images and
its map on chart sections. Source: Stacks Project, Tags 01PZ and 01N8
(blueprint: lem-sc-ample-proj-canonical-map).

Step 1: a positive-degree section `s` trivializes its tensor power on its nonvanishing
open (lem-weil-pbc-nonvanishing-section-trivializes). Dividing a homogeneous numerator of
degree `n * deg(s)` by `s^n` defines a ring map out of the degree-zero homogeneous
localization. The affine morphism correspondence (lem-weil-pbc-morphism-into-affine-scheme)
and the Proj chart isomorphism (def-pc-proj) give the local morphism.

Step 2: for sections of degrees `d` and `e`, the chart function `t^d / s^e` is invertible
exactly on the intersection of their nonvanishing opens. The two localized ring maps
agree there: both send `a / (st)^n` to the quotient by the section `(st)^n`. Thus their
morphisms to the affine chart `D_+(st)` agree by the affine morphism correspondence.

Step 3: the assumed cover and this overlap agreement glue the local morphisms
(lem-weil-pbc-scheme-morphism-gluing).

Step 4: on a chart for `t`, membership in the inverse image of `D_+(s)` is invertibility
of `s^e / t^d`. Since `t` trivializes its power, this is exactly nonvanishing of `s`.
This proves the inverse-image equality. The chart sections map is the ring map of Step 1.
The fraction formula below is written without division: its value times the trivializing
section `s^n` equals the numerator. Multiplication by this section is bijective, so this
is precisely the quotient `s^{-n} ξ`, including when the nonvanishing open is empty. -/
