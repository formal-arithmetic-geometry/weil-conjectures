/-- On the local spectrum, the stalk of the direct image of a higher direct
image equals total cohomology. The equivalence inverts every compatible restricted
resolution section-class map, followed by restriction to the corresponding open.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 02OD, proof of Lemma 30.20.7; Tag 01E4 for the section
class map and Tag 01FB for the cohomology restriction map.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-local-direct-image-stalk-cohomology)

Proof: Put A = O_y and c : Spec A → Y. Every neighborhood V of y pulls back to
all of Spec A. Consequently the germ maps identify the stalk at y of c_*N with
Gamma(Spec A,N), for every module N on Spec A. Every neighborhood of its closed
point is the whole spectrum, so this evaluation is exact: it is the closed-point
stalk functor. Apply it to the direct-image complex of an injective resolution K
of F'. Exact evaluation commutes with homology; sections of f'_*K are sections of
K on X'. The canonical resolution comparison therefore gives the claimed
isomorphism to H^p(X',F'). Its scalar map is Gamma-Spec followed by f'.appTop:
compatibility on structure-sheaf germs identifies the original stalk scalar with
its image under this map, so the comparison is A-linear.

For V containing y, the pullback-square identity identifies
W = g'^{-1}(f^{-1}V) with f'^{-1}(c^{-1}V) = X'. Expand D.targetClass into
resolutionSectionClass and the higher-direct-image resolution comparison.
Exact evaluation cancels the sheafification/homology comparison and theta, leaving
the cohomology class of D.target.sections. The component condition identifies
these sections with restriction of K; the augmentation condition makes its
resolution comparison the canonical one. This is exactly moduleCohomologyFMap
for the restriction-unit morphism. Augmented comparison lifts are homotopic, so
this equality holds for every I, K and D, rather than selected resolutions.
In degree zero this is the section-to-germ identification. Zero modules and an
empty X' give zero modules on both sides. No finiteness hypothesis is used. -/
