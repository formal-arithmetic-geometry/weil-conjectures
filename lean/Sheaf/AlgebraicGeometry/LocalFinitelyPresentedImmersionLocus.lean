/-- A base-change-stable, source-local predicate represented locally by locally
finitely presented immersions is represented by such an immersion over the entire base.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0BDL, final proof paragraph, spelling out the gluing.
(blueprint: lem-sc-local-finitely-presented-immersion-locus).

Proof:
1. Forget local finite presentation in hlocal and apply the existing
   exists_localImmersionLocus. This supplies an immersion q:Z to S representing P,
   including empty bases and empty test schemes.
2. Choose the given local representatives j_i:W_i to U_i and form the open cover
   of S indexed by its points. For each i, the pullback of q to U_i and j_i
   represent the same predicate. The global and local representing equivalences
   give a morphism a from the pullback to W_i and a morphism b from W_i to Z.
   The pullback universal property lifts b and j_i to a reverse morphism c.
   Cancelling the monomorphisms j_i and the pullback of q shows a and c are inverse.
3. Thus the pullback of q is an isomorphism followed by j_i, so it is locally of
   finite presentation. Apply target locality on the chosen open cover. The
   immersion and representing equivalence are those already supplied in step 1. -/
