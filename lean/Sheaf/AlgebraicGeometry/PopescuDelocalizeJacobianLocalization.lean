/-- Source: Stacks Project, proof of Tag 07F9, the final displayed localization,
and Definition Tag 00T6.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-popescu-delocalize-jacobian-localization)

Proof: Write D = R[x₀,x₁,...,x_N,w]/(f), with f inserted into variables 1,...,N,
and a = x₀*w*∏sⱼ. In D[1/a], x₀, w and every sⱼ are units. The image of the
ideal membership gives s₀ = h*Δ, so Δ is a unit with inverse h/s₀. Present D[1/a]
as R[x₀,x₁,...,x_N,w,y]/(f,a*y-1). This identification sends y to the inverse of a
and is inverse on every generator by the quotient and localization universal
properties. Select the c original variables specified by hc, and y, for the
Jacobian minor. The derivatives of f with respect to y are zero. The final
row/column has diagonal entry a; its other entries need not vanish but do not
contribute to the determinant, which is Δ*a. Its image is a unit. The naive
presentation with this selected injective variable map is therefore submersive;
apply SubmersivePresentation.isStandardSmooth. The inequality c+1 ≤ N+3 follows
from hc. Empty relation sets give Δ = 1; if a maps to zero the localization is
the zero ring and the same inverse relation presentation still applies. -/
