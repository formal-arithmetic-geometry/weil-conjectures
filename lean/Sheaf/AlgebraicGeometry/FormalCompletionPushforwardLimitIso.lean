/-- The supplied canonical comparison induces an isomorphism of limit sheaves.
Source: Stacks Project, Theorem 02OC (degree zero), and Lemma 088B, the paragraph
identifying the inverse limit of the modules M_n with the completion of M.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-formal-completion-pushforward-limit-iso)

Proof: Fix an affine open U = Spec A of Y and set I = J(U), H = f_*F and
M = Gamma(U,H). Restrict f to f^(-1)U; it remains proper, and F remains coherent.
The ideal-product and quasi-coherent quotient section formulas identify the sections
of H/J^(n+1)H with M/I^(n+1)M, compatibly with their quotient projections and
transitions. Pushforward sections on U are sections on f^(-1)U. The equation hκ
therefore identifies the section map of κ_n with the canonical quotient-induced
map in the degree-zero theorem on formal functions: the quotient projection is
surjective, so its equation determines this map. That theorem says the induced
map of A-module limits is an isomorphism. Evaluation of sheaves of modules on U
preserves inverse limits. Consequently evaluation of lim.map κ is an isomorphism
on every affine open. A sheaf map that is invertible on an affine basis is invertible:
the inverses commute with restriction by cancellation and glue on arbitrary opens.
Thus lim.map κ is an isomorphism of sheaves of modules. This makes no claim that
any individual κ_n is invertible. For the zero ideal the systems are constant;
for the unit ideal they are zero. Zero sheaves and the empty scheme give zero limits.
