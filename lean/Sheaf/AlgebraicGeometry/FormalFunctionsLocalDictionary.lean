/-! # The geometric dictionary for stalkwise formal functions

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 02OD, proof before applying Theorem 02OC
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-formal-functions-local-dictionary).

This identifies uncompleted cohomology and the finite quotient systems. It does not
assert a comparison of completed cohomology with an inverse limit.

/-- The geometric identifications used before applying the theorem on formal functions.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 02OD, proof, together with Tags 02KH, 01E4, 089W and 01FB
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-formal-functions-local-dictionary).

Proof: Put A = O_(Y,y), and base change f along the flat canonical map Spec A → Y.
A is Noetherian, the base-changed map is proper, and the pulled-back module is coherent:
pullback preserves quasi-coherence and finite type, which characterize coherence on
locally Noetherian schemes. Flat base change (02KH) identifies the higher direct image
stalk with the cohomology H on this base change. The section-class formula for flat
base change and the associated-presheaf description (01E4) identify this equivalence
on germs with pullback. Every open containing the closed point of Spec A is all of
Spec A, so the final stalk is global cohomology.
For each positive level n+1, paste the two pullback squares to identify the infinitesimal
fibre with the quotient base change of this local scheme. Its closed immersion has ideal
m^(n+1) O. The closed immersion unit has kernel m^(n+1) F', so it identifies the pushed
forward fibre module with formalModuleQuotient J (n+1) F'. The affine cohomology edge
isomorphism (089W) then gives the component of b. These components commute with
transitions: the two sheaf maps agree after precomposition with the epimorphic quotient
projection, hence agree; functoriality of the cohomology h-maps gives naturality.
Restrict the completed scalar action to A; on each component it is the same quotient
scalar action. The pullback maps on neighbourhood cohomology descend to A-linear maps
kappa on the stalk, by their compatibility with restrictions and the stalk colimit.
Functoriality identifies their values with b applied to the quotient restriction of a.
The section-class formula identifies these maps with IsFormalFunctionsTheta, for every
choice of injective resolutions and open comparison data. These arguments apply equally
to p=0, the zero module and an empty fibre; no nonzero or surjectivity hypothesis on a
finite-level cohomology map is used. -/
