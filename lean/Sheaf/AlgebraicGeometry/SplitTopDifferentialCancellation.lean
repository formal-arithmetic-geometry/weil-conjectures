/-- One split top differential can be removed without changing homotopy type.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 068V, explicit split cancellation; Tag 00MT,
contractible identity-pair argument.
(blueprint: lem-pc-split-top-differential-cancellation).

Proof: Let δ = B.d m (m+1) and choose a section σ with σ ≫ δ = 𝟙. Replace the term
in degree m by ker δ, retain the terms below m, and put zero in every degree above
m. Factor the incoming differential through ker δ using d squared = 0. These
maps define a cochain complex D. The inclusion ker δ into B.X m and the identity
in lower degrees define D to B. The endomorphism 𝟙 - δ ≫ σ factors through ker δ
and defines the reverse chain map, zero above m and identity below m. The two
chain-map equations at the changed degrees follow from d squared = 0 and σ ≫ δ = 𝟙.
Their composite on D is the identity. On B, the difference from the identity is
the boundary of the homotopy whose only nonzero component is σ from degree m+1
to degree m. Above m+1 all terms of B are zero by the support hypothesis, so this
homotopy proves the identity in every degree. Thus D is homotopy equivalent to B.
The kernel is a direct summand of B.X m; direct summands preserve flatness,
quasi-coherence and finite presentation (the latter by local finite presentations,
or equivalently the finite-projective criterion on affine opens). Other terms
are unchanged or zero. Since m is natural, replacing the degree m term and
removing higher degrees retains the lower bound zero. The case m = 0 removes
degree one and introduces no negative term; zero terms and the empty scheme
satisfy the same identities. No residue vanishing or affineness is required. -/
