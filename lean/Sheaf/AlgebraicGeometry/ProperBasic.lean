/-- A proper morphism is separated, universally closed, of finite type, quasi-compact,
and quasi-separated. Over an affine base, its source is separated and quasi-compact.
Source: blueprint node pqf-lem-proper-basic, order 528 (blueprint: pqf-lem-proper-basic).
Proof: By [def-weil-proper-morphism], unpack properness to obtain separatedness,
universal closedness, and finite type. Finite type means locally of finite type together
with quasi-compactness [def-weil-finite-type-morphism]; these are the third and fourth
conjuncts. Separatedness implies quasi-separatedness [lem-pc-separated-quasi-separated],
so the diagonal is quasi-compact. If the base is affine, it is quasi-compact; applying
quasi-compactness of `f` to the whole base gives quasi-compactness of `X`. Finally,
separatedness of `f` over the affine base gives separatedness of `X`
[lem-sc-separated-over-affine-scheme-separated].
