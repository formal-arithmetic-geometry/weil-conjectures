/-- The degreewise canonical boundaries, transported through the kernel and closed-immersion
cohomology comparisons, satisfy the two-term Leibniz recurrence. This asserts only the
recurrence; the closed power formula requires a separate induction.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 09MS, equation (30.17.5.1) and the direct-sum exact sequence
following it; Tag 0B8S, the Leibniz calculation for the connecting map.
(blueprint: lem-sc-square-zero-tensor-boundary-leibniz).
Proof:
1. Tensor the closed-immersion ideal sequence with L^d. Invertibility makes tensoring
exact, and its multiplication map identifies I tensor L^d with the categorical kernel
of the canonical tensor-pullback adjunction unit. The unit-quotient theorem identifies
its quotient with j_*j^*(L^d). The tensor-pullback comparisons and tensor-power
multiplication comparisons give a_e, including e=0 and n=0.
2. The equality I^2=0 annihilates every ideal-tensor kernel by I. The annihilated-module
unit isomorphism and the affine cohomology edge identify its H^1 on X with H^1 of
its pullback on Z. The generic module-pullback tensor comparison
(lem-weil-pbc-module-pullback-tensor), applied with the ideal-tensor module as
first factor, and associativity identify the degree n(e+1) pullback with F tensor N^e.
Take the inverse edge and kernel comparison on H^1 for the additive equivalence b_e.
Define c_e by applying its inverse to the canonical
boundary of the section s^(e+1) transported by a_e. This uniquely determines c_e;
there is no choice of an unspecified obstruction class.
3. Sum the ideal sequences in every nonnegative degree. Local frames identify their
middle graded algebra with a polynomial algebra, so it is commutative. Its kernel
is square zero since multiplying two ideal factors lands in I^2. Apply the boundary
derivation theorem of Tag 0B8S to the global section in degree n and its (e+1)-st
power. Project to degree n(e+2). The two terms are multiplication of c_e by s
and multiplication of c_0 by s^(e+1). Naturality of boundary maps for summand
inclusions and projections, and of the closed-immersion cohomology edge, transports
these products respectively to H^1(mulTensorPowSection s F e 1)(c_e) and
H^1(rho_F^-1; id_F tensor s^(e+1))(H^1(rho_F)(c_0)). Here rho_F transports
F tensor N^0 = F tensor O_Z to F. Comparison with the canonical derived triangle
identifies the resolution boundary with moduleSectionBoundary, giving the recurrence.
No induction on the exponent is used in these steps. -/
