/-- Pullback commutes with duals of finite locally free modules.

Source: Stacks Project, Modules, Example 0FNV and Lemma 01C8.

Proof: the evaluation pairing `M ⊗ dual M ⟶ O_X` pulls back to a pairing
`e^*M ⊗ e^*(dual M) ⟶ O_S`, using the tensor and unit comparisons of pullback.
Its transpose is a canonical map `e^*(dual M) ⟶ dual (e^*M)`. For each point of
`S`, choose a neighbourhood of its image on which `M` is finite free of rank `r`.
On the inverse image of this neighbourhood the map is the comparison
`O_S^r ⟶ Hom(O_S^r, O_S)`, which sends each dual basis vector to its coordinate
functional and is an isomorphism, including when `r = 0`. Thus the canonical map
is locally an isomorphism on an open cover, hence an isomorphism of sheaves.
Take its associated isomorphism.
