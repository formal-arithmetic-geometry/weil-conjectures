/-- The pullback of the strict henselization is the limit of the small affine
neighbourhood pullbacks, with qcqs stages and affine transition morphisms.
This supplies only geometry, with no derived sheaves, cocones or mates.
Source: Stacks, Tag 03Q9, first proof paragraph
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-strict-local-neighbourhood-geometry).

Proof: `strictHenselizationBaseChangeCone_exists` supplies the limiting cone over
exactly the same small affine neighbourhood diagram, with vertex S_(s) ×_S X and
both specified projection equations. Precompose its legs with pullback symmetry
from X ×_S S_(s), and transport the limit by the induced cone isomorphism.
Precomposing each supplied projection equation with that symmetry proves `first`
and `over`. Each neighbourhood is a spectrum, hence affine, compact and
quasi-separated. Its stage projection is a base change of f, so Mathlib's
`QuasiCompact.compactSpace_of_compactSpace` and
`quasiSeparatedSpace_of_quasiSeparated` prove the two stage properties. Each
transition is the base change of a map between affine neighbourhoods, so
`MorphismProperty.pullbackLift_fst_snd` proves that it is affine. No global qcqs
assumption on X or S is used. -/
