/-- Stacks Project, Cohomology of Schemes, Lemma 08DR: induction for quasi-compact opens
(blueprint: lem-sc-invert-s-cohomology-induction).

First handle separated quasi-compact opens using finite affine covers
(`lem-weil-pbc-qcqs-finite-affine-open-cover`). Induct on their size. The empty
open is affine. Adjoin the last affine V to the union U of the preceding charts.
Each chart's intersection with V is affine by
`lem-weil-pbc-separated-affine-open-intersection`. Thus both U and U ∩ V have
shorter covers and satisfy P by induction. Their separatedness follows from open
immersions and composition (`lem-weil-pbc-separated-cancellation` and
`lem-weil-pbc-proper-fp-permanence`). Apply the gluing hypothesis.

For any quasi-compact open W, induct on a finite affine cover in the same way.
Quasi-separatedness makes U ∩ V quasi-compact
(`lem-weil-pbc-quasi-separated-affine-cover-criterion`). It is separated as an
open of affine V (`lem-sc-separated-over-affine-scheme-separated` and
`lem-weil-pbc-separated-cancellation`). Apply
`lem-sc-invert-s-cohomology-separated-induction` to it, the induction hypothesis
to U, and the affine hypothesis to V, then glue. Finally take W = X. -/
