/-- Pulling back a finitely presented scheme module preserves finite presentation.
Source: Stacks Project, modules.tex, Tag 01BQ; sheaves.tex, Tags 0095--0097.
(blueprint: lem-pc-tensor-pullback-finite-presentation).

Proof: choose the local finite free presentations expressing finite presentation of M.
The inverse images of their open domains cover X. Restriction of tensor pullback to
one such inverse-image open is pullback of the corresponding restricted module.
Inverse image and sheafified extension of scalars are left adjoints, so their composite
preserves the cokernel presentation. Pullback of the structure module is the structure
module by the multiplication isomorphism b tensor a maps to b g-sharp(a), inverse
b maps to b tensor 1. It therefore preserves the finite free modules in both degrees
of each presentation, with their original finite index sets. These presentations on
the inverse-image cover give QuasicoherentData with finite presentations, exactly
SheafOfModules.IsFinitePresentation. Empty inverse-image opens may be discarded;
an empty source has the empty cover. No flatness hypothesis on g is required. -/
