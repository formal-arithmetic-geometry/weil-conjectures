/-- The canonical derived base-change map at a line bundle on a flat qc separated family
is invertible, without a hypothesis on its higher direct images.

Source: `ZeroScheme.lean`, `nonempty_arrowIso_pullback_directImageCounit` docstring,
first sentence of its proof; Stacks Project, Tag 0A1D.
(blueprint: lem-pc-flat-invertible-canonical-derived-base-change).

Proof: An invertible module is quasi-coherent and flat. Since f is flat, it is also
flat over the base (isFlatOver_of_isInvertible). Restrict to affine opens of S and S'
with the latter mapping into the former. Choose a finite affine cover of X over each
such open; all intersections are affine by separatedness. The alternating finite
Cech complex computes Rf_*M and has flat terms over the base ring. Tensoring these
terms with the new base ring computes derived pullback and gives exactly the Cech
complex of the pulled-back cover. The tensor comparison on each intersection is
induced by pullback of sections. Under the Cech augmentations it is the mate of
the pullback composition comparison, hence is the displayed canonical derived map.
Invertibility is local, so these comparisons prove the assertion globally. Flatness
of M over O_X identifies Lg'^*(M[0]) with (g'^*M)[0]; thus the ordinary-target version
of relatively flat base change and the displayed version differ by an isomorphism.
An arbitrary cartesian square is transported from the chosen pullback by its unique
projection-preserving isomorphism; naturality of the mate preserves the map. If a
base is empty the same argument uses zero complexes and needs no chosen point. -/
