/-- All compact objects jointly detect isomorphisms in D_QCoh(X).
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 09IS and 09M1; the detection step of Tag 0A9R.

Proof: Choose small-Hom derived models on X and its opens using K-injective
resolutions. Localization equivalences preserve quasi-coherence, shifted Hom
sets, and coproducts, so they transport the hypothesis and the desired conclusion.
Complete g to a distinguished triangle A → B → C → A[1]. The cone C has
quasi-coherent cohomology by the cohomology exact sequence. Every shift of a
perfect object is perfect, hence compact by Tag 09M1. The assumed Hom bijections
and the long exact Hom sequence therefore give Hom(P[n], C) = 0 for every
perfect P and integer n. The class of objects Q with Hom(Q[n], C) = 0 for all n
is closed under isomorphisms, shifts, cones, retracts, and arbitrary coproducts:
the cone assertion follows from exactness, and the coproduct assertion from the
universal property identifying Hom from a sum with a product. Perfect generation
makes this class all of D_QCoh(X). In particular the identity of C is zero, so C
is a zero object. Exactness now makes Hom(T, g) bijective for every T; Yoneda
implies g is an isomorphism. Transport this conclusion to the given model.
For the empty scheme the derived category is zero and the same argument applies. -/
