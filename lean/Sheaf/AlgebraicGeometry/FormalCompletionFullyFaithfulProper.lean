/-- Completion induces a bijection on morphisms between coherent modules on a proper
scheme over an adically complete Noetherian ring. The ideal of completion is I O_X:
transport I to global sections of Spec A, form its ideal sheaf, and extend it along f.
Noetherianity of X is derived from the proper morphism, not assumed separately.
Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology of Schemes, Lemma 0883 (lemma-fully-faithful)
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-formal-completion-fully-faithful-proper).

Proof:
1. Spec A is Noetherian, and properness makes f finite type, so X is Noetherian
   (lem-weil-pbc-finite-type-over-noetherian). The extended ideal I O_X is quasi-coherent:
   pull back the quasi-coherent ideal on Spec A and take its image
   (lem-weil-pbc-module-pullback-quasi-coherent,
   lem-weil-pbc-quasi-coherent-module-cokernel-image, def-nagata-extended-ideal).
2. The internal Hom H = Hom(G,F) is coherent
   (lem-weil-pbc-coherent-sheaf-hom-coherent), and its global sections are Hom(G,F)
   (def-pur-sheaf-hom).
3. Lemma 0882 (lem-weil-pbc-completion-internal-hom) identifies the inverse limit of
   global sections of H/I^n H with morphisms of the completed modules.
4. Formal functions in degree zero over the complete base
   (lem-weil-pbc-formal-functions-complete-base) identifies global sections of H with
   that inverse limit, by reduction modulo I^n.
5. The composite of these bijections sends u to its compatible family of reductions:
   evaluation of the reduced internal-Hom section is precisely u modulo I^n.
   Thus the composite is the map of def-weil-pbc-coherent-formal-module's completion
   functor, proving its bijectivity for every coherent G and F. -/
