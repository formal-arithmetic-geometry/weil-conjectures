/-- Source: Stacks Project, Theorem 37.53.5 (Tag 03H2), over `Spec A`.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-stein-factorization-affine)

For a proper `f`, put `B = Γ(X, ⊤)`. The canonical Stein factorization has first map
`X.toSpecΓ` and second map `f.steinFactorizationBase`. Its ring map is integral, its first
map is proper with geometrically connected fibres, and each ordinary fibre and topological
inverse image of a point is connected (thus nonempty). The underlying fibre maps
homeomorphically onto that inverse image by `Scheme.Hom.fiberHomeo`, with underlying map
`Scheme.Hom.fiberι`, as recorded in the scheme-fibre definition (Tag 01K1).

Proof route of the node:
1. Apply the universal factorization lemma (Tag 03GY),
   `lem-weil-pbc-stein-universally-closed-factor`, to the proper morphism. It identifies the
   intermediate affine scheme with `Spec B`, gives integrality of the second map, and gives
   universal closedness, quasi-compactness, quasi-separatedness and surjectivity of the first
   map, together with its structure-sheaf pushforward being the structure sheaf.
2. Separated cancellation (`lem-weil-pbc-separated-cancellation`) and permanence of finite
   type (`lem-weil-pbc-proper-fp-permanence`) make the first map separated and finite type.
   Together with universal closedness this gives properness.
3. Over the affine base, integrality of the second map is integrality of `A → B`; equivalently
   use `lem-weil-pbc-stein-integral-global-sections` and the affine global-sections isomorphism.
4. Replace the base by `Spec B`. The etale criterion (Tag 03GZ),
   `lem-weil-pbc-stein-geometric-fibre-etale-criterion`, reduces geometric connectedness to
   connectedness after affine etale base change. Properness survives base change, and flat
   base change of global sections (`lem-weil-pbc-stein-flat-base-change-global-sections`,
   Tag 02KH) keeps global sections equal to the new base ring.
5. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-stein-normalized-fibre-idempotent`: the node's formal-functions route
   identifies the completed local ring with the inverse limit of sections on infinitesimal
   neighbourhoods. A nontrivial fibre idempotent would lift to a nontrivial idempotent in a
   local completed ring, a contradiction; surjectivity gives nonemptiness. This proves
   geometric connectedness. The current Tag 03H2 instead uses Tag 0G7X to lift a fibre
   idempotent after principal localization; it then comes from the residue field and is trivial.
6. The fibre homeomorphism of `def-pc-scheme-fibre` (Tag 01K1) transfers connectedness and
   nonemptiness to the inverse-image subspace, using `def-weil-connected-scheme`.
