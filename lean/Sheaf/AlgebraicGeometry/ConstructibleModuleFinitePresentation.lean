/-- A constructible module sheaf on a qcqs scheme has a presentation by finite sums of
extensions by zero from affine etale objects. We use the project's `ModuleCat Λ` encoding
of modules over the constant ring sheaf. In this encoding `P W` is the sheafification of
`V ↦ Λ[Hom(V,W)]`, with restriction by precomposition; it is `j_{W!} Λ_W`. Sheafifying
with constant coefficients or first extending scalars to the constant ring sheaf gives
the same free sheaf, by the free-Yoneda and sheafification adjunctions.

Proof, following Stacks Project, Etale Cohomology, Lemma 59.73.6 (Tag 095N):
1. An affine etale object's extension by zero is constructible
   (`lem-weil-pbc-etale-free-sheaf-constructible`); finite sums are constructible by
   `thm-constructible-serre`, including the empty sum.
2. The free-Yoneda bijection (`lem-weil-pbc-free-yoneda-presheaf-module`) and the
   sheafification adjunction (`def-weil-presheaf-modules-sheafification`) turn a section
   over an etale object into a map from its extension by zero.
3. Finite stalks (`lem-weil-pbc-constructible-module-finite-stalks`) and the filtered
   colimit description (`lem-weil-pbc-pointed-etale-neighbourhoods-cofiltered`,
   `lem-weil-pbc-filtered-colimit-modules-elementwise`) let us represent all stalk elements
   by finitely many sections; shrink their neighbourhoods to affine ones using
   `lem-weil-pbc-pointed-etale-neighbourhood-affine-shrink`. These maps surject at that stalk.
4. For each finite family, its cokernel is constructible by `thm-constructible-serre`.
   Its support is constructible (`lem-weil-pbc-constructible-module-support-constructible`).
   Exactness of geometric stalks (`prop-weil-pbc-geometric-stalks-exact`) identifies this
   support with failure of stalkwise surjectivity; enlarging the family decreases it.
5. Choose a geometric point over each point (`def-weil-geometric-point`). Step 3 and
   independence of vanishing from the geometric point (the support lemma) give a finite
   family whose cokernel support avoids this point.
6. The qcqs scheme is spectral (`lem-weil-pbc-qcqs-scheme-spectral`). Compactness of its
   constructible topology (`lem-weil-pbc-spectral-constructible-finite-intersection`)
   makes finitely many such supports have empty intersection; concatenate their families.
7. The resulting cokernel has zero stalks. Conservativity
   (`lemma-weil-pbc-geometric-stalk-conservative`) makes it zero, so the map is epi.
8. Apply this construction to `F`, then to the constructible kernel of the resulting
   epimorphism `g` (again `thm-constructible-serre`). Compose the latter epimorphism with
   the kernel inclusion to obtain `f`. In the abelian module-sheaf category, `g` is its
   cokernel, giving the asserted cofork colimit.
