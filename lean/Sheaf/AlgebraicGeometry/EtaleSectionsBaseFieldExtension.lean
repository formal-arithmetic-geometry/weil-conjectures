(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-sections-base-field-extension).
Let `k` be separably closed, `K/k` a field extension, and `S` a `k`-scheme.
Pullback induces a bijection on sections of every sheaf of sets on `S`'s small étale site.
The map is the inverse-image/direct-image adjunction unit evaluated at the identity
étale object of `S`. Its target is the inverse image evaluated at the base change of
that object, canonically isomorphic to the identity object of `S_K`; composing with
this isomorphism gives exactly the canonical map to global sections on `S_K`.
The inverse image is the same Kan-extension/sheafification construction as the recorded
`Scheme.etaleSetPullback`, rather than an independently chosen equivalence of section sets.

Proof:
1. The map `Spec K ⟶ Spec k` is flat (a field extension is a free module) and
   quasi-compact (its source has one point). Thus its base change `p : S_K ⟶ S`
   is flat and quasi-compact, by lem-weil-pbc-flat-morphism-base-change and
   lem-pc-quasi-compact-base-change.
2. Over a geometric point `Spec L ⟶ S`, the fibre is `Spec (K ⊗[k] L)`.
   By lem-weil-pbc-field-tensor-irreducible, this ring has a unique minimal prime;
   its spectrum is irreducible, hence connected.
3. Apply lem-weil-pbc-etale-sections-flat-qc-connected-fibres (Stacks 0A3H) to `p`
   and `F`. This gives bijectivity of the canonical pullback map on sections. -/
