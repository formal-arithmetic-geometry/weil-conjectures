/-- A twist section has compatible ordinary fractions on a finite principal cover of
Spec(A_(f)), with evaluations agreeing with the original section.

(blueprint: lem-sc-proj-twist-finite-localization-data)

Proof: at each point use the local homogeneous-fraction witness of s. Choose a
homogeneous basic neighborhood inside its witness neighborhood and D₊(f). Multiply the
witness denominator by this neighborhood's defining element and by f, and multiply the
numerator by the same factors. The resulting homogeneous denominator h has positive
degree c and D₊(h) lies in the witness neighborhood. For u = h^b/f^c in A_(f), the affine
chart identifies D₊(h) inside D₊(f) with D(u). Quasi-compactness gives finitely many such
neighborhoods. Their chart elements u_i generate the unit ideal. In A_f localized at u_i,
h_i is invertible since h_i^b = u_i*f^c_i and f is invertible, so the witness fraction
defines t_i. On an overlap use the homogeneous element f*h_i*h_j of A. Both fractions
have the same evaluations s(p) at every point of its basic open, so homogeneous-prime
equality detection makes them equal in A localized at f*h_i*h_j. The universal properties
identify this ring localization with the iterated module localization at u_i*u_j, giving
the displayed compatibility. At a point of D(u_i), u_i maps to a unit in A_p; the ordinary
evaluation A_f → A_p therefore extends to the further localization. Its underlying
additive map sends z/1 to the ordinary evaluation of z and t_i to s(p). Every point lies
in some neighborhood. If the open is empty, f is nilpotent and both A_f and A_(f) are
zero; the empty cover has span top in this zero ring and evaluation is vacuous. -/
