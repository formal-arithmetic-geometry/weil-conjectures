/-- A finite principal cover carries fractions representing the section on every chart.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01M7, construction preceding Definition 27.8.3 (Tag 01M6).
(blueprint: lem-sc-proj-twist-finite-local-representatives)

Proof: around each point take a local homogeneous fraction for the section. Refine its
neighborhood by a homogeneous basic open contained in D₊(f), multiplying numerator and
denominator by its defining element and f. The new denominator h has positive degree c.
The affine chart sends this open to the principal open of h^b/f^c in A_(f).
Quasi-compactness extracts finitely many such opens; since they cover Spec(A_(f)), their
chart elements span the unit ideal. In A_f localized at h^b/f^c, h is invertible, so the
chosen fraction defines t. At every point where the chart element is invertible, the
ordinary map A_f → A_p extends by the module localization universal property. This
extension is linear for the A_(f)-action through A_p and sends t to the section value.
The chart cover supplies an invertible chart element at each point. For an empty chart,
use the empty family: A_(f) is the zero ring and there are no evaluation conditions. -/
