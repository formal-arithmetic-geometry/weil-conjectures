/-- On `Y = Spec A`, termwise associated sheaf induces the equivalence
`D(A) ≌ D_QCoh(𝒪_Y)`. Its inverse is derived global sections, with the
`Γ(Y, 𝒪_Y)`-module structure transported to `A` through `ΓSpecIso`. The composite
with the full-subcategory inclusion is triangulated for a compatible shift structure,
and it sends `A[k]` to `𝒪_Y[k]` for every integer `k`.

Source: Stacks Project, Lemma 36.3.5, Tag 06Z0
(blueprint: lem-pc-affine-qcoh-derived-equivalence).

Proof:
1. The affine tilde/Gamma adjunction (lem-weil-pbc-affine-tilde-gamma-adjunction)
   is fully faithful onto quasi-coherent sheaves. Tilde preserves colimits and kernels
   (lem-weil-pbc-quasi-coherent-module-kernel), hence is exact. The image of `A` is
   the structure sheaf. Termwise tilde therefore inverts quasi-isomorphisms, factors
   through localization, and lands in the full quasi-coherent derived subcategory.
2. Derive global sections using K-injective resolutions as for
   def-pc-derived-direct-image. The ordinary adjunction induces the derived unit
   and counit; applying exact tilde termwise computes its derived functor.
3. Affine vanishing (lem-pc-affine-vanishing) supplies the bound `N = 1` in
   lem-pc-unbounded-derived-functor-cohomological-bound. Apply that bound to the
   negative truncation, then use the truncation triangle and left exactness of Gamma
   on the nonnegative injective resolution to obtain
   `H^i(RΓ(Y,E)) ≅ Γ(Y,H^i(E))` for quasi-coherent derived objects.
4. Exactness of tilde and this comparison identify the cohomology maps of the
   derived counit and unit with their ordinary counterparts on quasi-coherent
   sheaves and modules. These are isomorphisms by the affine adjunction, so the
   derived functors are quasi-inverse equivalences. Their complex constructions
   commute with shifts and preserve cone triangles, giving triangulatedness.
5. The complex `A[k]` has `A` in degree `-k` and zero elsewhere. Termwise tilde
   gives the structure sheaf in that degree, namely `𝒪_Y[k]`.
