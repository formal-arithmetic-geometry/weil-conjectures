/-- Finiteness is equivalent before and after base change along a finite order thickening.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 09ZW, part (8)
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-thickening-finite-cartesian).

Proof:
1. If `f'` is finite, its base change is finite
   (lem-weil-pbc-finite-morphism-permanence).
2. Nilpotence of `i.ker` gives full support, hence surjectivity of the closed immersion
   `i`. Its base change to `X'` is a surjective closed immersion
   (def-sbc-first-order-thickening, lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersion-base-change,
   lem-weil-pbc-surjective-base-change, def-pc-base-change).
   Thus the cartesian square is a morphism of thickenings, as in Stacks Tag 09ZU.
3. If the base change is finite, it is integral and locally of finite type
   (lem-weil-pbc-finite-iff-integral-lft).
4. Integrality lifts along this morphism of thickenings
   (lem-weil-pbc-thickening-integral, Stacks Tag 09ZV (5)).
5. Local finite type lifts along the cartesian finite order thickening
   (lem-weil-pbc-thickening-lft-cartesian, Stacks Tag 09ZW (2)).
6. Hence `f'` is integral and locally of finite type, and therefore finite
   (lem-weil-pbc-finite-iff-integral-lft). Together with step 1 this gives the equivalence. -/
