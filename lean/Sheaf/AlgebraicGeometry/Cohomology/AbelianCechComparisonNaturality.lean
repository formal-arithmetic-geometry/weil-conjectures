/-- Canonical comparison maps commute with coefficient morphisms.

Source: Stacks Project, Tags 01EQ and 01FD, augmentation squares.
(blueprint: lem-pc-abelian-cech-comparison-naturality)

Proof: Choose injective resolutions I of F and J of G and a lift of f between
them. Apply the Čech functor degreewise and totalize. Restrictions commute with
the lift by presheaf naturality, and coefficient augmentations commute with it
by the lifting equation, giving the alpha and beta squares. Apply homology.
The constant-sheaf adjunction takes a representing Ext cocycle a on I to its
section cycle, and takes a composed with the lift to the image section cycle
on J. Mathlib's extMk_comp_mk0 identifies the latter cocycle with the image of
the Ext class under H(f). For every input Čech class, apply the two defining
comparison equations to these representatives. The augmentation squares imply
that both proposed images agree after H(alpha on J) and the section-complex
identification. The row-augmentation quasi-isomorphism makes H(alpha on J)
injective, and Ext computed from J makes the identification injective. Cancel
both maps. Ext representatives exist by extMk_surjective. This proves equality
on every class and hence equality of the two additive morphisms. Empty spaces,
zero sheaves, and infinite covers are included by the same constructions. -/
