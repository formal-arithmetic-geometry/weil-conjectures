/-- Normalized additive Čech comparisons can be chosen compatibly with inverse image.
There is no acyclicity hypothesis and no assertion that either comparison is invertible.

Proof: Resolve abelian sheaves by injectives and form the augmented ordered Čech
bicomplex. The augmentation from the global-section resolution is a quasi-isomorphism
because positive Čech cohomology of injectives vanishes. Invert it on total cohomology
and compose with the coefficient augmentation to obtain a natural transformation in
all degrees. In degree zero this is gluing followed by the sections-to-Ext identification.
A short exact coefficient sequence that is sectionwise surjective on tuple intersections
induces a short exact Čech sequence; comparing its resolution sequences proves the
connecting-map law. For the displayed coefficient map, resolve the direct image of the
target resolution and compare with the source resolution. The augmented pentagon and
the two global-section squares in 01FD commute. The coordinate hypothesis identifies
the two coefficient augmentations. Taking total cohomology and inverting the injective
Čech quasi-isomorphisms gives the asserted equality. The global-section comparison is
exact inverse image on Ext with the inverse constant-sheaf isomorphism, followed by the
adjoint coefficient map. The same construction works for all modules, including those
which are not quasi-coherent, and for infinite covers. On an empty scheme all complexes
and cohomology groups are zero; degree zero is the ordinary section map. -/
