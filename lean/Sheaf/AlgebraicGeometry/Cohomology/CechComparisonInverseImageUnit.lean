/-- The comparison commutes with inverse image for the adjunction unit alone.
Unlike coefficient naturality, this assertion concerns only one abelian sheaf and
its exact inverse image. There are no module coefficients or scalar restrictions.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01FD, Lemma 20.15.1, with the coefficient map equal to
identity on inverse image; Tag 01EQ, Lemma 20.11.2, for the comparison construction.

Proof: First replace each normalized comparison by the augmented-resolution map.
For uniqueness, embed F into the product of the direct images of its restrictions
to the members of the cover. On each tuple intersection one factor retracts the
embedding, so its cokernel sequence is surjective on tuple sections. Inserting
the distinguished member contracts the Čech complex of each factor in positive
degrees; products of abelian groups are exact. Thus the connecting map onto every
positive Čech group is surjective. Induct on degree, using naturality and the
connecting laws to compare the two maps on images of these connecting maps.
Degree zero is their common normalization. This establishes uniqueness.

Choose injective resolutions of F and of its inverse image, and resolve the direct
image of the latter resolution. Lift the adjunction unit between these resolutions.
The resulting Čech double complexes form the augmented pentagon of Tag 01FD.
Its coefficient face commutes by the lift equation and its section faces commute
by restriction functoriality. The section augmentations are quasi-isomorphisms,
since injective Čech rows are augmented exact and total diagonals are finite.
Apply homology and invert these augmentations to obtain the outer square. The
right side agrees with the Ext map of exact inverse image: both agree in degree
zero with pullback of global sections through the constant-sheaf isomorphism and
commute with boundaries, so injective effacement identifies them in every degree.
Finally uniqueness substitutes the supplied normalized systems. For an empty
cover hcover makes X empty; then Y is empty as well, and all maps are zero. -/
