/-- An effacement sequence split on cover members is suitable for both covers.

Source: `lem-pc-cech-comparison-inverse-image-unit`, proof Step 1; relative
Čech effacement used to identify normalized comparisons in Tags 01EQ and 01FD.
(blueprint: lem-pc-cech-cover-relative-effacement)

Proof: Set E to the product, over i, of the direct image of F restricted to U i,
and embed F by its restriction maps. This map is monic because the U i cover X.
Let Q be its cokernel. On U i, projection to the i-th factor retracts F → E,
so the cokernel sequence splits on U i and on every tuple intersection contained
in U i. Hence E → Q is surjective on all nonempty tuple sections. Exact inverse
image preserves the sequence and its splitting on preimages of U i. Every
V-tuple intersection lies in the preimage of its first U-member, so the pulled
back quotient map is also surjective on all V-tuple sections. In the Čech
complex of each direct-image factor, insert i at the front of a tuple; the
alternating face identity gives dh + hd = id in positive degrees. The Čech
complex of E is the product of these complexes; products of abelian groups are
exact, so E has zero positive Čech cohomology. The long exact sequence of the
sectionwise short exact Čech complexes therefore makes every positive connecting
map surjective. For an empty index, hcover forces X empty; Y is empty too and
the zero short exact sequence has every required property. -/
