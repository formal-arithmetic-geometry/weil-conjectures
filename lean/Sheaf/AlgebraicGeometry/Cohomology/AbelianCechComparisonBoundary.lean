/-- The augmentation quotient commutes with connecting maps for sequences
surjective on every tuple intersection. Canonicity is an essential hypothesis.

Proof: Take horseshoe injective resolutions of the three terms of T. Their
sequence is split exact in each resolution degree. Applying sections on any
tuple intersection preserves those splittings, as do products and the finite
direct sums on total diagonals. This gives short exact sequences of section
complexes and total complexes. The tuple-surjectivity hypothesis gives the
short exact sequence of coefficient Čech complexes. The three alpha maps and
the three beta maps form morphisms of these short exact sequences; each square
is restriction naturality or the horseshoe augmentation equation. Naturality
of homology connecting maps yields delta-Cech followed by H(beta on T.X1)
equals H(beta on T.X3) followed by delta-total, and delta-sections followed by
H(alpha on T.X1) equals H(alpha on T.X3) followed by delta-total. The
constant-sheaf Hom adjunction identifies the section-complex boundary with
the Ext boundary: both are represented by lifting a cocycle to the middle
resolution, taking its differential, and lifting the result through the first
inclusion. This is Sheaf.functorHdelta with the same sign convention. Replace
the two beta maps by the assumed canonical comparison equations on these
horseshoe resolutions. Cancel the invertible alpha map and the canonical
Ext/section identification in degree q+1. The resulting identity is the one
asserted below. No hypothesis of canonicity on the middle sheaf is needed.
Degree zero uses the same boundary construction; the empty-cover case is zero.
Finite total diagonals give the argument for arbitrary covering index sets. -/
