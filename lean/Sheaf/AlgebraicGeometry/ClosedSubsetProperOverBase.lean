/-- A closed subset is proper over the base if its reduced induced closed subscheme is proper.
The ideal `IdealSheafData.vanishingIdeal Z` consists of sections vanishing at every point of
`Z`; its subscheme is the reduced induced structure of Stacks Tags 01J3 and 01J4, as stated
in `IdealSheafData.reduced_induced_closed_subscheme`, including uniqueness over `X`.

namespace Modules

/-- The support of `F` is the set of points where its stalk is nonzero, written below as
failure of `Subsingleton` for the stalk (the project's inline support convention).
It has support proper over the base exactly
when this set is closed and is proper over the base with its reduced induced structure.
The existential closed subset expresses closedness without assuming it for arbitrary `F`.
