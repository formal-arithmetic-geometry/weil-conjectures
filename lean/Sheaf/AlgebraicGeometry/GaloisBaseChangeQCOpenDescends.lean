/-- A quasi-compact open descends to a finite intermediate field and is invariant under
all automorphisms fixing that field. Source: Stacks Project, Varieties, Tag 04KU and the
preceding Galois-action equation.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-galois-base-change-qc-open-descends).

Proof:
1. Functoriality of `Spec` (def-weil-affine-spectrum) and `baseChangeMap`
   (def-pc-base-change) gives the contravariant composition law. The map for the inverse
   algebra automorphism is an inverse, so every induced scheme map is an automorphism.
2. Apply lem-weil-pbc-descend-qc-open-fg-subalgebra (Stacks Tag 0388) with algebra `L`.
   It gives a finitely generated subalgebra and a quasi-compact open pulling back to `V`.
3. Every generator is algebraic, hence integral, since `L/k` is Galois
   (def-weil-pbc-separable-algebraic-extension, def-weil-algebraic-element).
   By lem-weil-pbc-finite-of-integral-generators the subalgebra is finite-dimensional.
   It is a domain inside `L`, so lem-weil-pbc-finite-dimensional-domain-is-field makes
   it a field. Take this finite intermediate field as `K` and the descended open as `V'`.
4. If `σ` fixes `K` pointwise, its composite with the inclusion `K → L` is that inclusion.
   Functoriality of `Spec` and base change yields `σX σ ≫ p = p`.
5. Thus `(σX σ) ⁻¹ᵁ V = V`. Since `σX σ` is bijective, its image of `V` is also `V`.
   The fixing subgroup of a finite intermediate field is open in the Krull topology;
   this is the open subgroup in Stacks' formulation of part (2). -/
