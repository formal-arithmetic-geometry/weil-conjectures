/-- Base change of a first order thickening is a first order thickening, with ideal
`i.ker.comap p`, the extended ideal of def-nagata-extended-ideal. The two projections
commute with `p` and `i`, giving a morphism of thickenings (Stacks Project, Tags 09ZU,
01JU (1), and 04EX (5)).

Proof:
1. The closed immersion component of the hypothesis gives a local instance.
   Closed immersions are stable under base change, so the first projection is
   a closed immersion.
2. Mathlib's `Scheme.IdealSheafData.ker_fst_of_isClosedImmersion` identifies its
   kernel with `i.ker.comap p`.
3. The proved source-library `Scheme.IdealSheafData.comap_pow` identifies the
   square of this extended ideal with `(i.ker ^ 2).comap p`. The hypothesis
   makes this `⊥.comap p`, which is `⊥` by `Scheme.IdealSheafData.comap_bot`.
4. The closed immersion and square-zero kernel give the first order thickening.
   The defining pullback equation supplies the required commuting square.
