/-- Algebraization on the supplied quasi-projective modification with proper support on Y.
Source: Stacks Project, Theorem 088E, the projective compactification argument
(https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/088E), using Tags 0885, 0CYJ, and 0CYQ.
(blueprint: new-chow-algebraization-core)

Proof: Properness of q makes Y Noetherian. Factor the quasi-compact immersion e as
an open immersion j into its scheme-theoretic image Y', a closed subscheme of the
supplied projective space. Pull G back using exists_formalSystemsPullback. Nakayama and
compatibility of successive quotients identify the supports of all pulled terms with
the inverse image of the degree-zero support. By hR and properness of q this set is
proper over A. Its image under j is closed in Y'. Extend the pulled terms by j_*;
coherence follows from pushforward_coherent_on_open. On j(Y) quotient compatibility
is unchanged, and off the closed support all terms vanish, so the extended terms
form a coherent formal system. Projective existence algebraizes it to F' on Y'.
Nakayama identifies its support over V(I) with the degree-zero support. The boundary
part of Supp(F') is closed in the proper Y', so its image in Spec A is closed. If
nonempty it meets V(I), since I is in the Jacobson radical of the complete ring A,
contradicting the degree-zero support calculation. Thus Supp(F') lies inside j(Y).
Restrict F' to Y. Its completion is the pulled system by the restriction/completion
comparison; its support is the transport of the proper closed support of F'. -/
