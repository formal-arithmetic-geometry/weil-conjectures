/-- Local finite presentation descends along an fpqc covering family of the target.
Source: Stacks Project, Descent, Lemma Tag 02KY
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-fpqc-descend-locally-finite-presentation).

Proof:
1. Local finite presentation is invariant under isomorphisms: affine neighbourhoods and
   their finite algebra presentations transport across the isomorphisms. It is Zariski local
   on the target: affine neighbourhoods in open subschemes are affine neighbourhoods in the
   ambient scheme (def-sbc-locally-finite-presentation, def-pc-scheme,
   def-weil-pbc-finitely-presented-algebra).
2. It is stable under base change (lem-weil-pbc-qcqs-morphism-permanence, clause 3; Tag 01TS).
3. For a flat surjective map of affine schemes, write the bases as Spec R and Spec R'.
   The corresponding ring map is flat and surjective on prime spectra, hence faithfully
   flat (lem-weil-pbc-flat-ring-map-iff-flat-affine,
   lem-weil-pbc-flat-surjective-spectrum-faithfully-flat).
4. For an affine open Spec A of the source, its inverse image in the base change is affine
   and has ring A tensor R'. Cartesian-square pasting and the affine fibre-product formula
   identify its projection with the base-changed ring map
   (lem-weil-pbc-open-preimage-fibre-product, lem-weil-pbc-cartesian-square-pasting,
   lem-weil-pbc-fibre-product-affine-spectra). Local finite presentation of the base change
   makes this ring map finitely presented (lem-weil-pbc-lfp-affine-opens-finite-presentation).
   Swapping tensor factors makes R' tensor A a finitely presented R'-algebra.
5. Finite presentation descends through the faithfully flat ring map R to R'
   (lem-weil-pbc-finite-presentation-descends-faithfully-flat, Tag 00QQ). Every source point
   lies in an affine open, so the original morphism is locally of finite presentation.
6. These are the isomorphism-invariance, base-change, Zariski-locality and affine-descent
   conditions of lem-weil-pbc-fpqc-local-on-base-criterion (Tag 02KP). Applying that criterion
   to the given fpqc covering proves the conclusion. -/
