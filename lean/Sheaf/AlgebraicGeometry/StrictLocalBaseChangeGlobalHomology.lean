/-- The homology of the derived base-change mate is invertible on strict-local sections.
This only asserts invertibility after global sections; it does not assert that the mate
is an isomorphism of sheaves on the strict-local base.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 03Q9, the affine-neighbourhood continuity argument and the
injective-representative construction of the canonical map
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-strict-local-base-change-global-homology).

Proof: choose a bounded-below injective representative J of K. For each affine pointed
étale neighbourhood V of s, restriction of J to X ×_S V preserves injectives, so its
sections complex computes that neighbourhood's hypercohomology. Sheafification of this
cohomology presheaf gives H^n(Rf_*K) (03Q8), and sheafification leaves its geometric stalk
unchanged. Cofinality of affine pointed neighbourhoods identifies this stalk with the
filtered colimit of their hypercohomology. The strict henselization is their inverse limit;
fibre products with X commute with that limit. Each X ×_S V is qcqs because f is qcqs and
V is affine, and transitions are affine by base change of morphisms between affine schemes.
Derived continuity (0GIT) identifies the colimit with hypercohomology of the limit pullback
of K. Strict-local global sections are exact, and coincide with the closed-point stalk
(03QO); hence the source of the displayed map computes the same colimit, while its target
computes limit hypercohomology through Leray. At the level of J, the adjunction mate is
restriction of sections along the pullback square. After taking H^n this is the continuity
map on every neighbourhood. The equality on all germ components, and the colimit universal
property, therefore identify the displayed map with the continuity isomorphism. No torsion
assumption is needed by 0GIT.
