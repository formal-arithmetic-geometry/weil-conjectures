/-- Module-to-abelian comparisons identify cup products with the class of 1 with
projection pullbacks. There is no assumption on the global structure ring maps.

Proof: For X and Y use the comparison computed on injective module resolutions after
forgetting to abelian sheaves. Forgotten injective modules are acyclic for abelian
sections, so the common sections complex gives additive equivalences. Identify
terminal-open cohomology with Ext from the constant integer sheaf by its adjunction.
On the product, tensor pullback identifies the pullbacks of both unit modules with the
unit module, and the tensor unitor identifies their tensor product with the unit.
Compose the induced coefficient isomorphism with the same abelian comparison to get eP.
The canonical map from sections to zeroth derived sections sends 1 to the cocycle 1
in any computing resolution. Pullback preserves this cocycle. The computing tensor
pairing with 1 is the identity after the unit coefficient identification: sectionwise
it sends s tensor 1, or 1 tensor s, to s. Therefore cup with this class, on either
side, is projection pullback on the common resolution complex. A lift of the structure
sheaf map computes the abelian pullback defined using exact inverse image and Ext;
comparison maps between resolutions are homotopic, so the induced cohomology maps
agree with the recorded structureSheafCohomologyPullback. This gives both formulas
using the same eP. One degree is zero, so the interchange introduces no sign.
This argument works for empty schemes and does not use properness, separatedness,
compactness, or any assertion that external cup products span. -/
