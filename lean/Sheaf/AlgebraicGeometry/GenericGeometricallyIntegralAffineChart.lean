/-- A generically geometrically integral affine family contains an affine open
whose geometric fibres are irreducible near the generic point. This only controls
the open subfamily; it makes no assertion about the rest of the source fibres.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0559, the separating transcendence basis and common
open construction; Tag 0557, spreading an absolutely irreducible polynomial.
Proof: write the integral affine base as Spec A and the reduced affine source as
Spec B. Flatness makes B embed in its generic fibre, which is a geometrically
integral domain. The fraction field L of that domain is a regular finitely
generated extension of K=Frac A. A separating transcendence basis and a primitive
element give L=K(x_1,...,x_r)[x_(r+1)] with an absolutely irreducible minimal
polynomial. Take its primitive numerator over K and clear base denominators
to obtain P over A. After a base localization and the monic change of variables
described below, the hypersurface ring embeds in its generic fibre and is a
domain. After shrinking the base,
the hypersurface Spec(A[x_1,...,x_(r+1)]/(P)) and Spec B have isomorphic nonempty
affine opens over A: write the finitely many generators of each algebra as
fractions in their common function field and invert their denominators. Spread
absolute irreducibility of P by Tag 0557: a triangular substitution by separated
powers makes P monic in its last variable after inverting its leading
coefficient. For each positive pair of possible factor degrees, bounded-degree
monic factor coefficients and the coefficient equations for their product form
a finite type algebra. There is no point of its generic fibre over the algebraic
closure, so Nullstellensatz makes that fibre zero. Inverting a nonzero base
element kills this algebra. Invert the finite product of those elements. Now P
is irreducible over every algebraically closed residue field, and the
hypersurface fibres are geometrically integral. Its common affine open W is
therefore geometrically irreducible whenever nonempty. Generic flatness of W
and its finite presentation make its image open; shrink to this image to ensure
nonemptiness of every fibre. Choose a further affine base neighbourhood and
view W as an affine open in the original source. All shrinkings contain the
generic point. Relative dimension zero uses a linear polynomial, so the set of
positive factor-degree pairs is empty. Empty source is excluded by the generic
irreducibility hypothesis.
