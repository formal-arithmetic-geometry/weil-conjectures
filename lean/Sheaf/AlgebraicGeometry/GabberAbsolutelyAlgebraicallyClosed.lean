/-- Let `R` be a normal domain with separably closed fraction field.  For every closed
subscheme `Z` of `Spec R`, the positive-degree étale cohomology of every finite constant
abelian sheaf vanishes.

Source: Stacks Project, `etale-cohomology.tex`, Lemma 09ZC
(label lemma-gabber-for-absolutely-algebraically-closed).

Proof (the five steps of the node):
1. By `def-weil-closed-immersion` and `def-weil-affine-spectrum`, write `Z` as
   `Spec (R/I)` over `Spec R`. The induced isomorphism of small étale sites preserves
   coverings, the terminal object, constant sheaves, and global sections. It therefore
   transports their derived cohomology (`def-weil-pbc-etale-cohomology`).
2. The stalks and function field of `Spec R` are the prime localizations and fraction
   field (`lem-weil-pbc-spec-domain-stalks-function-field`). Those localizations are
   normal domains (`lem-weil-pbc-localization-normal-domain`). Thus Stacks 09Z9,
   `sbc-lem-etale-over-normal` (2), makes every local ring strictly henselian.
3. At a prime of `R/I` with preimage `p`, the local ring is `R_p / I R_p`.
   By `lem-weil-pbc-strictly-henselian-quotient` (05WS), it is strictly henselian too.
4. For `h` in `R/I`, lift it to `f` in `R`. If `f = 0`, `D(h)` is empty and all
   abelian sheaves and their cohomology are zero. Otherwise `R_f` is a normal domain
   with the same separably closed fraction field. Localization commutes with quotient
   (`lem-weil-pbc-localization-quotient-commute`), so `Spec ((R/I)_h)` is a closed
   subscheme of `Spec R_f` (`lem-weil-pbc-spec-quotient-closed-immersion`). Stacks 09ZB,
   `lem-weil-pbc-gabber-h1-absolutely-algebraically-closed`, gives zero `H¹` there.
   Identify this spectrum with `D(h)` using
   `lem-weil-pbc-principal-localization-open-immersion` and transport as in step 1.
   Pullback preserves the constant sheaf (`lemma-constructible-pullback-constant`).
5. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-gabber-criterion` (0GY0) to `R/I` and the constant sheaf.
   Its local rings are strictly henselian by step 3. The required restriction map
   from `H¹(D(f+g))` has zero kernel because its source is zero by step 4.
   All positive cohomology vanishes; step 1 transports this vanishing back to `Z`.
