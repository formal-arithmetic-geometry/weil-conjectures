/-- Every pseudo-coherent object of `D(𝒪_Y)` has quasi-coherent cohomology in every degree.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 08E5 (lemma-pseudo-coherent), invoked in the proof of Tag 08EE
(blueprint: lem-sc-pseudo-coherent-qcoh).

Proof: By `def-pur-pseudo-coherent-complex`, each point has an open neighbourhood on which
`E` is represented by a bounded-above complex of finite free modules. Its cohomology sheaves
identify with the restrictions of those of `E`. The terms are quasi-coherent by
`pqf-def-coherent`: on an affine open they are associated to finite free modules. The kernel
of each differential is quasi-coherent by `lem-weil-pbc-quasi-coherent-module-kernel`.
Its quotient by the preceding differential's image is quasi-coherent by
`lem-weil-pbc-quasi-coherent-module-cokernel-image`; this quotient is the cohomology sheaf.
Quasi-coherence is local by `pqf-def-coherent`, so every cohomology sheaf of `E` is
quasi-coherent. This is membership in `D_QCoh(𝒪_Y)` by `def-pc-derived-category`. -/
