/-- The reduced generic pullback embeds in a separably generated field after a radicial
base extension. No geometric reducedness of the fibre is asserted here.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0559, second proof, and Tag 030R.
Proof: write the base and source as Spec A and Spec B and let K be the fraction field
of A. Localization preserves reducedness, and geometric irreducibility makes B_K a
nonzero domain. Its fraction field L is finitely generated over K. Tag 030R gives a
finite purely inseparable extension K'/K such that the reduced tensor L tensor_K K'
is a separably generated field F over K'. To obtain this from Tag 04KM, take the
compositum in the common purely inseparable upper field. It is a finitely generated
separable subextension of that separably generated extension, so is separably generated.
Scale the finitely many generators b_i of K'/K: if b_i^q = a/d, the element d*b_i has
q-th power a*d^(q-1) in A. Adjoin these scaled elements inside K' to form A'. This
is a finite integral domain with fraction field K', and all its elements have purely
inseparable power equations over A. Thus Spec A' to Spec A is a universal homeomorphism.
Let eta' be its unique point over eta. Localization and reduction commute, identifying
the reduced generic fibre with Spec of (B tensor_A K')_red. The injection B_K into L
remains injective after the flat field extension K'/K. Passing to reductions preserves
injectivity, since nilpotence is detected by an injective ring map. The induced injection
of the reduced generic coordinate ring into F gives a scheme-theoretically dominant
map Spec F to the fibre. It is quasi-compact because both schemes are affine. Its
composite to Spec kappa(eta') is the spectrum map of the displayed field algebra.
In characteristic zero use K'=K; nonemptiness excludes the zero ring in the field
construction. Every scheme is a spectrum or canonical reduction, not arbitrary data
chosen by a definition from an unproved existence statement.
