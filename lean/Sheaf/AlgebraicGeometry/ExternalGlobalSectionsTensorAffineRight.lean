/-- The external section comparison when the second factor is affine.
Source: Stacks Project, Varieties, Tag 0BED, lemma-kunneth, the comparison on X times V.
(blueprint: lem-sc-external-global-sections-tensor-affine-right).

Proof: Choose a finite affine open cover U_i of X. The affine-diagonal criterion makes
U_i intersect U_j affine. Put A_i = Gamma(U_i,O), B = Gamma(Y,O), M_i = F(U_i), and
N = G(Y). The affine product formula identifies U_i times Y with Spec(A_i tensor_k B).
The affine pullback formulas and the affine tensor-section formula identify sections of
pr_1^*F tensor pr_2^*G there with M_i tensor_k N. To see this algebraically, pull back
M_i and N to A_i tensor_k B, then tensor the resulting modules over that ring; the map
(m tensor b) tensor (a tensor n) goes to (a*m) tensor (b*n), and its inverse sends
m tensor n to (m tensor 1) tensor (1 tensor n). The same formulas apply to each overlap.
The adjunction-unit pure-tensor formulas identify these maps with the external section
map, and their naturality identifies the overlap maps with restrictions in M_i tensor N.
Apply the sheaf equalizer to the finite cover U_i of X and its inverse-image cover of
X times Y. Tensoring over the field with N preserves the kernel of the difference of
restriction maps and the two finite products. Thus the resulting equalizer comparison
is bijective. On each chart it sends s tensor t to the tensor of their projection
pullbacks, hence equals externalGlobalSectionsTensor by tensor induction and sheaf
uniqueness. An empty X has an empty equalizer and zero sections. An empty affine Y has
B and N zero, and both sides vanish. Zero coefficients are handled by the same formula.
No assertion that tensor preserves infinite products, and no higher cohomology, is used.
