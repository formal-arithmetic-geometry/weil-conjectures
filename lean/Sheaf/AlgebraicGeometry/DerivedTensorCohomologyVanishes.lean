/-- Vanishing of `H^i(E ⊗ᴸ F)` is expressed by a K-flat representative `P` of `E`
whose total tensor with `F` in degree zero has zero cohomology in degree `i`.
The representative is required to exist: this predicate cannot hold vacuously.
K-flat resolutions exist (Tag 06YS), and different K-flat representatives compute
isomorphic derived tensor products (Tag 06YU). Thus existential choice of a
representative gives exactly vanishing of the derived tensor cohomology sheaf.
