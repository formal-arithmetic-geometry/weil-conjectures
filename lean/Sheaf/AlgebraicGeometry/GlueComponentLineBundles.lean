Let `Y` be reduced and covered by finitely many closed subschemes `i a : Z a ⟶ Y` with
discrete pairwise intersections. Invertible modules `M a` on the components glue to an
invertible module on `Y`, and sections nonvanishing at every point of the pairwise
intersections glue as well (Stacks, Varieties Lemma 09NE).
Module pullback is `tensorPullback` (def-pc-module-pullback); `res N a` is restriction of
global sections to `Z a`, the unit of its canonical adjunction
(lem-pc-module-pullback-adjunction). `X_s` is `nonvanishingLocus`
(def-weil-pbc-ample-invertible-module): nonzero in the residue-field fibre.

Proof (the direct proof of Varieties Lemma 09NE):
1. Let `T` be the union of pairwise intersections. It is closed and discrete. Off `T`,
   the components form a disjoint scheme cover, by reducedness. The restriction identity
   for sections is `lem-sc-glue-component-reduced-cover-sections`.
2. Choose neighbourhoods `U_t` meeting `T` only at `t`. Shrink them to trivialize every
   component module, excluding components not containing `t`. In the prescribed-section
   case shrink further until each section is a generator, and choose its frame to send
   it to `1`. Cover each component off `T` by trivializing opens `U_ij` of `Y`.
3. Use the component frame changes on overlaps. Opens from different components off
   `T` are disjoint. The restriction identity in step 1 identifies component functions
   with functions on overlaps in `Y`, including the product decomposition for overlaps
   of distinct `U_t`. The frame changes satisfy the cocycle condition. Apply
   `lem-sc-glue-component-transition-cocycle` to glue the invertible module and its
   component restriction isomorphisms.
4. For prescribed sections, take `1` on each `U_t` and the local expression of `s_i`
   on each `U_ij`. The normalized frames make these expressions compatible with the
   transition cocycle of step 3 (`lem-sc-glue-component-transition-cocycle`). The sheaf
   axiom glues them to one global section restricting to all the prescribed sections.
