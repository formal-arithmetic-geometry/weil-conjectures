/-- A derivation into the diagonal conormal has the prescribed difference formula if,
whenever the two projections pull a section `a` back to an ambient open `W`, its value
is the tensor-pullback class of their difference. The kernel section `s` is specified by
its image under the kernel inclusion. This uses the canonical tensor-pullback unit.

/-- The difference of the two projections defines a relative derivation into the
conormal sheaf, with its sectionwise difference formula.

Proof: restrict the actual kernel ideal to the neighbourhood of the diagonal in Tag 01KJ.
Modulo its square, inverse image along the diagonal gives a square-zero extension of
`O_X` by the conormal. Both projections split its quotient onto `O_X`. Their difference
lies in the kernel and satisfies the Leibniz rule: the error term is a product of two
kernel sections and vanishes modulo the square. The projections agree on functions
from the base, so the difference is relative to `f`. These constructions commute with
restriction and therefore define a sheaf derivation. Identify the square-zero kernel
with tensor pullback of the ideal: on a closed-immersion chart this is `I/I²`, and its
class map is the canonical tensor-pullback unit. This gives the displayed normalization
on every ambient open `W`; equality can be checked locally on the same charts. -/
