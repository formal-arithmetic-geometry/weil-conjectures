/-- The closed fibre of a proper scheme is a directed limit of the closed fibres
of proper models over finite-type integer rings, with affine transitions.
This construction depends only on the proper morphism and its base ideal; no cover
or descent of a cover is part of its conclusion.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0GS2, proof, General case, first approximation paragraph;
Tag 0A0P, proper Noetherian approximation.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-proper-closed-fibre-approximation).

Proof:
1. Apply proper Noetherian approximation with its affine clause to f. Choose the
   proper stages X_i over Spec R_i, where R_i is finite type over the integers,
   and the compatible projections p_i and ring maps alpha_i : R_i -> A. Their
   rings have colimit A, and the schemes X_i have limit Y.
2. Put K_i = alpha_i^{-1}(I). The transition maps preserve these ideals. The
   quotient cocone has colimit A/I: represent any element by an element of a
   stage ring; if its image is zero modulo I, that representative already lies
   in K_i. Equivalently, compatible maps from all R_i/K_i induce a map from A
   that kills I, and therefore a unique map from A/I.
3. Apply Spec to this quotient colimit. Pullbacks commute with limits, so the
   closed fibres X_i,0 have limit Y_0. The projections are induced by p_i and
   the quotient ring maps; the pullback projection equations give exactly the
   two compatibilities below. Isomorphisms e allow arbitrary choices of objects
   for the resulting diagram without imposing definitional equalities.
4. A transition X_j,0 -> X_i,0 factors through the base change of X_i,0 to X_j:
   the first map is a closed immersion, because the extended K_i is contained
   in K_j, and the second is a base change of the affine transition X_j -> X_i.
   Thus transitions are affine. Each closed fibre is proper over an affine
   scheme, hence quasi-compact and quasi-separated. This also covers I = top,
   when every closed fibre is empty, and the zero base ring. -/
