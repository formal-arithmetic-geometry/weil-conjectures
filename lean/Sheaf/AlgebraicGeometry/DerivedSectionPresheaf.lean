/-! # The unbounded derived section cohomology presheaf

Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology, Tag 0D5X
(blueprint: def-pc-derived-section-presheaf).

Resolve on the source, then take direct image as a presheaf of modules and its
cohomology. Evaluation on an open is exact in the presheaf category, so this is
precisely the presheaf of cohomology of derived sections, including its restriction
maps and its module structure. It does not take cohomology in the sheaf category.

/-- The presheaf `V ↦ Hⁱ(RΓ(f⁻¹V,E))`, with the restriction maps induced by the same
K-injective resolution and the `𝒪_Y(V)`-action induced by `f`. We derive the composite
of direct image and the inclusion into module presheaves, then take cohomology in
that presheaf category. Its standard derived-category implementation is internal:
only the resulting presheaf functor is exposed.
