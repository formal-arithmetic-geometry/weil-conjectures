/-- An ambient derived morphism is invertible if it is invertible on an open
neighbourhood of every point. No quasi-coherence or boundedness assumption is needed.
Source: Stacks Project, duality.tex, Tag 0AAB (locality), and the cohomology criterion
for derived isomorphisms in Mathlib, `DerivedCategory.isIso_iff`.
(blueprint: lem-sc-derived-open-restriction-detects-iso)

Proof: Exact open restriction commutes with every cohomology functor. Thus each
cohomology morphism restricts to an isomorphism on every prescribed neighbourhood.
A morphism of sheaves of modules locally invertible on such neighbourhoods is an
isomorphism: its underlying abelian sheaf morphism is locally injective and locally
surjective, and the local inverses glue uniquely. Hence every cohomology morphism
is an isomorphism. The cohomology functors jointly reflect derived isomorphisms,
so the original morphism is invertible. Degrees are treated separately, so there
is no boundedness condition. On the empty scheme the locality hypothesis is vacuous
and all sheaves, hence all derived objects, are zero, giving the same conclusion.
