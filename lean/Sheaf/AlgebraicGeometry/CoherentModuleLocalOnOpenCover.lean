/-- Coherence of a module is preserved by restriction to opens and is local on an open cover:
(1) if `F` is coherent then `F|_W` is a coherent `𝒪_W`-module for every open `W`; (2) if every
`F|_{U i}` is coherent and the `U i` cover `X`, then `F` is coherent. Restriction is Mathlib's
`Scheme.Modules.restrictFunctor` along the open immersion `W.ι`, coherence the project's
`RingedSpace.IsCoherent` (pqf-def-coherent).
Source: Stacks Project, Modules, Definitions 01BV and 01B5; the locality is used in
Cohomology of Schemes, Lemma 0CYJ (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-coherent-module-local-on-open-cover).

Proof:
1. Restriction facts for opens `V ⊆ W ⊆ X`: `𝒪_X|_W = 𝒪_W` and `(G|_W)|_V = G|_V`
   (lem-weil-pbc-module-restriction-open-immersion-colimits); restriction is a left adjoint,
   so it preserves `𝒪^{⊕ n}` and epimorphisms; kernels are sectionwise, so restriction commutes
   with kernels (def-weil-sheaf-of-modules-category); finite type is invariant under isomorphism.
2. Finite type restricts: restrict a local surjection `𝒪_U^{⊕ n} → G|_U` to `U ∩ W`.
3. Part (1): `F|_W` is of finite type by 2; a map `𝒪_{W'}^{⊕ n} → (F|_W)|_{W'} = F|_{W'}`
   has kernel of finite type by the kernel condition for `F`, `W'` being open in `X`.
4. Finite type is local: a local surjection onto `G|_{W_i}` near `x` is one onto `G` near `x`.
5. Part (2): `F` is of finite type by 4. For `φ : 𝒪_W^{⊕ n} → F|_W` with kernel `K`, on
   `W_i = W ∩ U i` the restriction `K|_{W_i}` is the kernel of a map
   `𝒪_{W_i}^{⊕ n} → (F|_{U i})|_{W_i}`, of finite type by coherence of `F|_{U i}`; so `K` is of
   finite type by 4, and `F` is coherent (pqf-def-coherent).
