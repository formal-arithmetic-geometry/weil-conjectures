/-- Deleting the tail copy of the junction advances the partially sorted prefix.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01FM, equation 20.23.6.1, labelled-deletion verification.
Proof: Write b=tau^{-1}(sigma(a)). Since tau agrees with sigma before a, injectivity
of sigma implies b>=a. Move tau(b) to position a, shifting entries a,...,b-1 right.
This is tau composed with the inverse interval cycle (a ... b). It agrees with
sigma through a. Its remaining tail is the old increasing tail with tau(b) removed,
so remains increasing. Thus it equals rho: both have the same prefix and their
increasing tails enumerate the same complement. In the junction map, positions
0,...,a are sigma(0),...,sigma(a), and later positions are tau(a),...,tau(p+1).
Deleting position b+1 leaves exactly the moved tuple: below a the prefix is unchanged,
at a the entry is tau(b), from a+1 through b it is tau(k-1), and above b it is tau(k).
These are also the four cases of the inverse interval cycle. This proves both
function equality and permutation equality. If b=a the cycle is identity and the
adjacent duplicate is removed. If a=p+1 the advanced tail is empty and rho=sigma.
