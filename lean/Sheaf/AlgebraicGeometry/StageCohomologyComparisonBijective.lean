/-- Stage continuity makes every certified comparison bijective.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 09YQ, universal property of its comparison.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-stage-cohomology-comparison-bijective).

Proof: For the system constructor apply continuity at its specified stage.
The colimit universal property identifies the comparison with an isomorphism.
Isomorphisms are bijective; composition and products preserve bijectivity.
No Mayer--Vietoris exactness or middle comparison is used here. -/
