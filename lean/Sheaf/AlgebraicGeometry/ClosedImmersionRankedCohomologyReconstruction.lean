/-- Over the algebra of a closed immersion, rank-stratified cohomology determines
its derived object. M is arbitrary: this is the assembly step, independent of any
Koszul resolution, regularity, normal bundle, or scalar right adjoint.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0BQZ (single-degree reconstruction) and Tag 0AVW
(algebra-valued direct image); the parent node's proof, step 3
(blueprint: lem-sc-closed-immersion-ranked-cohomology-reconstruction).

Proof:
1. For a closed embedding, direct image of sheaves is exact: at a point of Z its
   stalk is the original stalk, and outside Z it is zero. The identity ring map
   in g = toDirectImageAlgebraSpace i makes this an exact functor of modules.
   Consequently Rg_* is computed by termwise g_* on every complex, without a
   quasi-coherence or boundedness hypothesis. The zero-differential exterior
   complex has homology equal to locallyRankedExteriorTerm in each degree.
2. The clopen fibers of r cover Z. The finite-image hypothesis makes this a finite
   partition. Glue one on a fiber and zero on its complement to obtain sections
   e_n of OZ. Their images in i_* OZ are mutually orthogonal idempotents whose
   sum is one. Multiplication by them splits every algebra-module complex
   termwise, compatibly with its differentials and quasi-isomorphisms.
3. Apply this splitting to a representative of K. By hK, its e_n summand has zero
   cohomology outside degree n, and in degree n has the e_n summand of g_* of
   the stated exterior term. Canonical truncation above and below n gives a
   zigzag of quasi-isomorphisms to that module placed in degree n. In the derived
   category this is the single-degree reconstruction furnished by the standard
   t-structure. Apply the same truncation to the corresponding summand of the
   termwise pushed-forward exterior complex and use the cohomology isomorphism.
4. Take the finite direct sum of the summand isomorphisms and use the splitting
   isomorphisms of step 2. Step 1 identifies the exterior side with Rg_* of its
   localization, with independent chosen derived-category universes.
For empty Z the algebra is zero and every complex is zero. Rank zero gives a
single degree-zero summand. Different ranks are split by the algebra idempotents;
their images are not assumed open or clopen in Y. -/
