/-- Separatedness and local quasi-finiteness are preserved by base change.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 01KU and 01TM.

Proof:
1. The diagonal of the second projection is the base change of the diagonal of `f`.
   Closed immersions are stable under base change, giving the first implication
   (lem-weil-pbc-separated-base-change).
2. Local quasi-finiteness implies local finite type
   (lem-weil-pbc-lqf-locally-finite-type), which survives base change
   (lem-weil-pbc-lft-base-change).
3. For any point upstairs, quasi-finiteness at its image gives an isolated point of
   the fibre (lem-weil-pbc-quasi-finite-at-point-isolated). This isolation survives
   base change (lem-weil-pbc-isolated-fibre-point-base-change).
4. Choose affine neighbourhoods of the point and its image with the first mapping
   into the second (lem-weil-pbc-affine-opens-basis).
5. The isolated-fibre-point affine-pair criterion
   (lem-weil-pbc-isolated-fibre-point-quasi-finite-affine-pairs) gives a finite-type
   ring map quasi-finite at the corresponding prime. This is quasi-finiteness at
   the point (pqf-def-quasifinite). Since the point was arbitrary, the projection
   is locally quasi-finite.
