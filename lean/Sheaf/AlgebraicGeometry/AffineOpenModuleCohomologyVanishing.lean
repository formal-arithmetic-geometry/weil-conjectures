/-- A quasi-coherent module has zero positive-degree cohomology on every affine open.
Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology of Schemes, Lemma 30.2.2, Tag 01XB
(blueprint: pqf-lem-affine-vanishing).

Proof:
1. Regard the affine open U as its induced open subscheme. Its structure sheaf is the
restriction of the structure sheaf of X, and F restricted to U remains quasi-coherent.
The hypothesis IsAffineOpen U says precisely that this induced scheme is affine.
2. Apply affine-scheme vanishing (lem-pc-affine-vanishing) to U and the restricted
module, obtaining zero cohomology in every positive degree. The comparison between
abelian-sheaf cohomology in that input and module cohomology uses the acyclicity of
injective O_U-modules (Stacks Tag 03FD).
3. Cohomology on U of the restricted module is the displayed openModuleCohomology:
restriction of injective module resolutions to an open remains injective (Tag 01E1).
Thus the vanishing is exactly H^p(U,F) = 0 for each p > 0. -/
