/-- Two derived objects with an overlap identification extend to one ambient derived object.
Only objects and their transition are constructed; there is no assertion about maps.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 08DG, its direct-image cone construction.
(blueprint: lem-sc-ambient-open-gluing-object).

Proof: Take the direct-image sum M = RjW_* A plus RjV_* B and the overlap image N
of B restricted to W intersect V. The relative difference-diagram theorem gives
d : M to N, projection maps pW, pV and an overlap counit k. Its split local
normal forms say that (pW, JW(d)) and (pV, JV(d)) are isomorphisms, and its
difference identity gives the relation between the overlap projections.
Complete d to a distinguished triangle G to M to N to G[1]. Restrict this
triangle to W. Compare it with the split biproduct triangle A to A plus JW(N)
to JW(N) to A[1]; the isomorphism (pW, JW(d)) on middle terms and the identity
on last terms give an isomorphism on first terms by the two-out-of-three
lemma for morphisms of distinguished triangles. Its first morphism is JW(f)
followed by pW. Thus that composite is invertible; similarly JV(f) followed
by pV is invertible. Use these composites as jW and jV. Precompose the
difference identity by restriction of f to the overlap. Naturality of sW and
sV rewrites its left side as the difference of the two requested transition
composites. Its right side is zero because f followed by d is zero in a
distinguished triangle. The difference-zero equation is the desired transition.
No cover hypothesis is used; empty and disjoint opens satisfy the same
split local normal forms and distinguished-triangle calculation. -/
