/-- On an affine spectrum the actual sheaf quotient projection is surjective and has
kernel the ideal power times the original module. No completeness or finiteness is needed.

Proof: The tilde unit identifies M with the global sections of its associated sheaf.
The ideal sheaf associated with I has global ideal I after transport by ΓSpecIso.
Induct on the positive exponent to identify the range of the power inclusion with I^m:
the first power is J.toModulesι, and each successor is the image of multiplication by J.
The affine tensor-sections comparison identifies the range of multiplication of this
power with the tilde module as I^m times all sections. The product and its cokernel are
quasi-coherent. Exactness of affine sections on quasi-coherent modules says the cokernel
projection is surjective with kernel this range. Transport through the tilde unit gives
the asserted surjectivity and kernel equality. At I=bottom the kernel is zero; at I=top
the quotient is zero. The zero module causes no exception. -/
