/-- A quasi-compact separated étale morphism into a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme is
finite étale after base change to each member of a finite constructible locally closed
stratification of its target.

Source: More on Morphisms, Lemma Tag 07RZ, and Etale Cohomology, Lemma Tag 03S9
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-etale-separated-stratified-finite).

Proof:
1. `j` is étale, hence flat, locally of finite presentation and unramified, so locally
   quasi-finite; being quasi-compact it is quasi-finite, and it is separated.
2. Tag 07RZ (`lem-weil-pbc-flat-fp-qf-stratification`) gives closed subsets
   `∅ = Z_{-1} ⊆ Z_0 ⊆ Z_1 ⊆ ⋯` with strata `Y_r = Z_r \ Z_{r-1}` partitioning `X`, such
   that `U ×_X T → T` is finite locally free of degree `r` iff `T → X` lands in `Y_r`, and
   every inclusion `Y_r → X` is quasi-compact.
3. `U` is quasi-compact, so the fibre degrees are bounded by some `n`; hence `Y_r = ∅` for
   `r > n` and `X = Y_0 ⊔ ⋯ ⊔ Y_n`, a finite partition.
4. Each `Y_r` is locally closed, and constructible since its inclusion is quasi-compact in
   the spectral space of the qcqs scheme `X`.
5. Give `Y_r` the reduced closed subscheme structure in the open `X \ Z_{r-1}` and compose
   with the open immersion: an immersion with image `Y_r`.
6. By step 2 the base change of `j` to each stratum is finite locally free, hence finite,
   and étale by base change. -/
