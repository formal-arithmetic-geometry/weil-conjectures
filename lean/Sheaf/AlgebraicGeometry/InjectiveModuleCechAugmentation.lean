/-- For an open cover, restriction of global sections into the Čech complex of a
single injective module is a quasi-isomorphism. The supplied map's degree-zero
component is precisely the canonical restriction map, including the scalar
identification at the whole space.

Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology of Sheaves, Tag 01EP
(lemma-injective-trivial-cech), and its use in the proof of Tag 01EQ.
(blueprint: lem-sc-injective-module-cech-augmentation).

Proof: Sheaf gluing identifies the kernel of the first Čech differential with
sections on the union of the cover, which is the whole space. Under this
identification the augmentation is restriction, so its map on degree-zero
cohomology is an isomorphism. An injective module is injective as a presheaf of
modules, since sheafification is an exact left adjoint to inclusion. Applying
Hom into it to the free Čech chain complex gives exactness in every positive
degree, as in Stacks 01EP and 01EN. Equivalently, use injective-implies-flasque
and flasque Čech acyclicity. These component calculations are unchanged by
restriction of scalars to the global section ring: kernels and images are
computed in the underlying abelian groups. The source single-term complex has
zero positive cohomology, so the augmentation induces isomorphisms in those
degrees as well. At degree zero its incoming differential is zero, giving the
kernel just identified. This proves quasi-isomorphism in all degrees. For an
empty covering the covering hypothesis forces the scheme to be empty, and
both section and Čech complexes are zero. -/
