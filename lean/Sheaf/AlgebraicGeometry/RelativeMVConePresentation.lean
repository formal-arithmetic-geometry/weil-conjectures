/-- Construct a strict square of first restriction maps whose functorial cones
compute the two relative overlap terms. This is the enhanced Mayer--Vietoris
construction; no short exact replacement on the base is required here.

Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology, Tags 08BV, 08HY and 08HZ, and Derived Categories
of Schemes, Tag 0DJ9, the induction diagram.
(blueprint: lem-pc-relative-mv-cone-presentation).

Proof: Choose K-injective resolutions with injective terms for K and K'. On each
cover the restriction units and their difference form the short exact sequence
of Tag 08HZ. The inverse-image cover is still compact: g is a morphism between
affine schemes, hence affine, as is its base change g'. Restricting a K-injective
complex to an open remains K-injective. Transpose the given object morphism along
the derived adjunction for g', and represent the transposed morphism by a chain
map into a K-injective resolution. Its restrictions give a strict morphism of
Mayer--Vietoris diagrams. Compute Rf* and Rf'* by these resolutions and Lg* by
K-flat resolutions of the entire diagram. Resolve the finite arrow diagram,
rather than its vertices independently, so its first square is a strict chain
square t ≫ b = a ≫ t'. Call the resulting first arrows t and t'. Their cones
compute the overlap terms because the original restriction rows are short exact
and both derived functors are triangulated. Functoriality of this cone comparison
identifies the induced cone map with the relative overlap comparison. Exact open
restriction computes derived open pullback. Compare its adjunction with the pinned
adjunction by uniqueness of right adjoints, and compare composite direct images
by the right-adjoint mates of the pinned pullback composition isomorphisms.
Naturality of units identifies the localized first maps; transposing restricted
counits identifies the cone inclusions with the difference maps. Expanding the
base-change mate, and using the equality of the two pullback projections, gives
the displayed global and overlap component equations, including the given φ.
This comparison is made before choosing short exact mapping-cylinder models.
For an empty open the corresponding restriction complex is zero, and for a
repeated open the row is split; the same cone construction applies. -/
