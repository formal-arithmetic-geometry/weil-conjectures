/-- The diagonal conormal on an affine chart is the ring's Kähler differential module.
Every normalized difference derivation has the expected formula in these coordinates.

(blueprint: lem-sc-diagonal-conormal-affine-sections).
Proof: set `A = Γ(X,U)` and `R = Γ(S,V)`. The open `U ×_V U` in `X ×_S X` is
`Spec(A ⊗[R] A)`, and its inverse image under the diagonal is exactly `U` (Tag 01KJ).
The diagonal restricted to this open is closed, with ideal the kernel of
multiplication `A ⊗[R] A → A`. Restriction of the actual module-sheaf kernel agrees
with this ideal sheaf: restriction preserves kernels and the diagonal pushforward
restricts to the pushforward of the restricted diagonal. Tensor pullback commutes
with these restrictions. Apply `Scheme.Modules.affine_conormal_sections` to this
closed diagonal, obtaining the canonical identification of conormal sections with
`I/I²`, including its formula on ideal sections. In Mathlib `KaehlerDifferential R A`
is this cotangent quotient; its `A`-action is the quotient action through
multiplication. Hence the identification is `A`-linear. For `a ∈ A`, the ambient
section `1 ⊗ a - a ⊗ 1` belongs to the multiplication kernel, so it gives an ideal
section. The class-map formula of the affine conormal equivalence and the defining
normalization of any `D` identify its image with `D.d a`. Finally
`KaehlerDifferential.D_apply` identifies its cotangent class with `d a`. The chart
and the equivalence depend only on `f,U,V`, and this argument applies to every
normalized `D`. No global closed-immersion hypothesis on the diagonal is needed. -/
