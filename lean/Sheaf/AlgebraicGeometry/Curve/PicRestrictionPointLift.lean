/-- Closed points lift to the compactification and their point-ideal classes pull back correctly.
Source: blueprint, sec-curve-estimates/sk-prop-cd-affine/lem-sc-pic-affine, first paragraph;
restriction and boundary divisors, steps 1 and 4 of lem-sc-pic-restriction-exact
(blueprint: lem-sc-pic-restriction-point-lift).

Proof: Send Q to c.i(Q). A closed point of a finite-type curve over the algebraically closed
field is a rational point, so its image in the separated finite-type curve c.Z is closed.
The open immersion identifies the stalks at Q and its image. Pullback of the vanishing ideal
of the image is the vanishing ideal of Q: on this open subscheme both are the ideal defining
that reduced point. Pullback commutes with the dual of an invertible module. Therefore the
classes of the dual point ideals satisfy the displayed equality. This is the single-point
case of restricting O(D); arbitrary divisors follow by the group law. No boundary point is
chosen, and the assertion remains valid when the boundary is empty. -/
