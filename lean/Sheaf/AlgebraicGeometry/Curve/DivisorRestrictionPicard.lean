/-- Restricting a divisor retains its coefficients and computes Picard pullback.
Source: blueprint, sec-curve-estimates/sk-prop-cd-affine/lem-sc-pic-affine, first paragraph,
restriction and boundary divisors
(blueprint: lem-sc-divisor-restriction-picard).

Proof: the open immersion is injective on points and identifies the local rings. A closed
point of C maps to a closed point of Z because it is rational over the algebraically closed
field and Z is separated over that field. Conversely a closed point of Z in the image has a
closed preimage by continuity and injectivity. Retain just the coefficients at these points;
this constructs a finitely supported divisor R on C. On a retained point the point-lift
comparison identifies the pullback of its point-ideal class with the class on C. On an omitted
point the boundary-triviality comparison gives the identity. Induct on the finite sum of
point divisors, using additivity and integer powers to obtain the Picard equality. If D is
zero, take R zero; if the boundary is empty every coefficient is retained. -/
