/-- The complement of a dense open in a curve over an algebraically closed field is a finite
set of closed points with separably closed residue fields.
Source: blueprint `lem-sc-brauer-zero-all-curves`, Proof, Step 2 (normalization).
(blueprint: lem-sc-dense-open-finite-complement)

Proof: The curve is Noetherian because it is finite type over a field. For every
irreducible component Z, the complement W of all the other components is open and
has closure Z. Thus W is nonempty and density forces V to meet W, hence Z. The
subspace Z is irreducible and has dimension at most one. Its nonempty open V ∩ Z
therefore has closed points as its complement, by the dimension-one specialization
chain argument. For x outside V, apply this to a component containing x. Since Z
is closed in C, the singleton {x} is closed in C. The closed complement of V is then
finite by the Noetherian closed-points finiteness theorem. Finally the residue field
of each closed point is isomorphic to the algebraically closed base field by the
Nullstellensatz, hence is algebraically closed and separably closed. The empty curve
and the empty complement satisfy all three clauses vacuously. -/
