/-- Forgetting constant-ring module structures preserves a module-sheaf colimit cocone.

(blueprint: lem-pbc-u2-module-sheaf-underlying-colimit)

Proof: Form the colimit of the underlying module presheaves sectionwise. The forgetful
functor from modules to abelian groups preserves these colimits: each compatible family
of additive maps extends uniquely, and its extension commutes with scalar multiplication
when the family is linear. Sheafify this presheaf colimit. Module sheafification and
abelian sheafification have identical underlying abelian sheaves, since their local
relations and gluing are the same. Therefore the sheafified underlying abelian cocone
has the colimit universal property. Any other module colimit cocone is uniquely
isomorphic to this one compatibly with every leg. Forget this isomorphism to transfer
the abelian colimit property to the given cocone. This works for empty diagrams as
well as filtered diagrams, and for the zero ring and the zero sheaf. -/
