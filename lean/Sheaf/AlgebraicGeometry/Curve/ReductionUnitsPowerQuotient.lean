/-- Consecutive nilpotent-units sheaves have an additive quasi-coherent quotient.
This single-step statement needs neither a global nilpotence exponent nor a
Noetherian hypothesis, and concerns only sheaves on X, before reduction pullback.
Source: blueprint `lem-sc-brauer-zero-all-curves`, Proof, Step 1 and its Claim.
(blueprint: lem-sc-reduction-units-power-quotient)

Proof: Let N be the nilradical ideal sheaf and set F=N^(j+1)/N^(j+2). Ideal powers
are quasi-coherent, and so is their quotient. On an affine etale object V over X,
base change identifies restriction to the subscheme cut out by N^(j+1) with
restriction of rings modulo the extended ideal. Thus reductionUnitsPowerKernel X j
is the group 1+N^(j+1) O_V. The assignment 1+a to the class of a defines a map to
sections of F: etale flatness identifies the quotient of extended ideals with
the pullback of F, compatibly with restriction. This is a group homomorphism
because the cross term ab belongs to N^(2j+2), which is contained in N^(j+2).
Its kernel is exactly 1+N^(j+2), with its evident inclusion. On etale affines
every quotient class has a lift a in the ideal, and a is nilpotent because the
extended nilradical is a nil ideal. Consequently 1+a is a unit. This proves
local surjectivity, hence an epimorphism of sheaves. These maps give the short
exact sequence, and sectionwise additive-group universe lift preserves it.
The construction also applies when N=0, when X is empty, and when j=0: then the
cross-term inequality is equality. No choices from this theorem define any data. -/
