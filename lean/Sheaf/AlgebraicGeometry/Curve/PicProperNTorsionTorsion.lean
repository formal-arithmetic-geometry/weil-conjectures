/-- The prime-to-characteristic Picard torsion for a proper smooth curve.
Source: blueprint `lem-sc-pic-proper-ntorsion`, the Jacobian calculation.
(blueprint: lem-sc-pic-proper-ntorsion-torsion)

Proof in words: Finite type gives local Noetherianity, smoothness gives regularity,
and connectedness then gives irreducibility. The dimension-one condition therefore makes
`f` smooth of relative dimension one. Over the separably closed field, connectedness is
geometric connectedness. Smoothness makes each field base change regular and reduced;
geometric connectedness makes it irreducible, so the curve is geometrically integral.
Apply `exists_jacobian`: its degree-zero Picard group is the group of rational points of
an abelian variety J, smooth of relative dimension the arithmetic genus. Its topological
Krull dimension is consequently that genus; Serre duality identifies it with `f.genus`.
The nonzero image of n in k implies n > 0 and that the characteristic does not divide n.
Clause (c) of `abelianVariety_estimate_of_isAlgClosed` computes the additive n-torsion of
J(k). For a Picard class L with L^n = 1, applying the degree homomorphism gives
n * degree(L) = 0 in the integers. Since n is nonzero, degree(L) = 0. Inclusion therefore
identifies the power-map kernel in Pic(C) with that in Pic⁰(C), with inverse the same class
viewed in the degree-zero subgroup. Restrict the Jacobian group equivalence to these kernels,
identify the power-map kernel with the additive n-torsion subgroup, and compose with the
abelian-variety torsion equivalence written multiplicatively. This works also for n = 1
and genus zero, when the resulting finite function group is trivial. -/
