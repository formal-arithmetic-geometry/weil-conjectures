/-- Source: blueprint, `sec-curve-estimates/sk-def-pic`, node lem-sc-pic-proper-decomposition,
order 888 (blueprint: lem-sc-pic-proper-decomposition).

Let `C` be a proper smooth connected curve over the algebraically closed field `k`. The degree
sequence `0 → Pic⁰(C) → Pic(C) → ℤ → 0` splits: `Pic⁰(C)` is a subgroup `P0` of `Pic(C)` with
underlying set `f.picZero`, and there is an isomorphism `Pic(C) ≅ ℤ × Pic⁰(C)` (`ℤ` written
multiplicatively, as the group law of `Pic(C)`) whose first component is the degree and which
restricts to the identity on `Pic⁰(C)`.

Proof, step 1: by lem-sc-smooth-connected-curve-local-rings (2) `C` has a closed point `P`,
which is `k`-rational by lem-weil-pbc-closed-point-residue-field-base. The degree of def-sc-pic0
is the degree of divisors transported along `Cl(C) ≅ Pic(C)` (lem-sc-divisor-class-curve, well
defined by lem-sc-deg-principal-zero), a homomorphism; `λ = [𝒪_C(P)]` has degree `deg [P] = 1`
(def-sc-divisor), so `s : n ↦ λ^n` is a homomorphism with `deg ∘ s = id`, and the degree is
surjective.
Step 2: `Pic⁰(C) = ker deg`, so the sequence is exact at `Pic⁰(C)` and at `Pic(C)`, and step 1
gives exactness at `ℤ`. The map `x ↦ (deg x, x · s(deg x)⁻¹)` lands in `ℤ × Pic⁰(C)`, is a
homomorphism, and has inverse `(n, y) ↦ s(n) · y`; its first component is the degree and it
restricts to the identity on `Pic⁰(C)`, i.e. the sequence splits. -/
