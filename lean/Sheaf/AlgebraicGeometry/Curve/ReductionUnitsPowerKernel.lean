/-- The j-th nilpotent-units sheaf on X is the kernel of restriction of units to the
closed subscheme cut out by the (j+1)-st power of the nilradical. On an etale affine
object it consists of units congruent to one modulo the pulled-back ideal power.
This is a kernel construction, independent of any existence theorem for filtrations.
