/-- For J contained in I, the additive image of the ideal of I on the subscheme of J
is the etale sheaf associated with the specified module cokernel J to I.
There is no nilpotence or square-zero hypothesis in this additive assertion.

Proof: Refine any etale object by affine etale V over affine open U=Spec A of X.
Write B=Gamma(V,O), and I_B,J_B for the extended ideals. The kernel of restriction
of functions to V times_X Z_I has sections I_B; restriction to V times_X Z_J
sends this ideal to its image in B/J_B. Its kernel is J_B, since J is contained
in I. Thus the sectionwise additive image is I_B/J_B. Flatness of B over A
identifies this quotient with B tensor_A coker(J(U) to I(U)). The specified
ideal modules are kernels of the same structure-module restrictions, so their
affine sections are precisely I(U) and J(U), and the specified inclusion is the
ordinary inclusion. The affine tensor description identifies the latter tensor
product with sections of the pullback of the specified module cokernel.
These linear identifications commute with restriction because quotient maps,
ideal inclusions and tensor base change commute with ring maps. Sheafifying
the presheaf image and gluing the comparisons on affine etale refinements gives
the stated sheaf isomorphism. Finally lift additive groups to the Gm universe;
the lift is an equivalence onto its image and preserves the identifications.
For I=J both sides vanish; the zero ring and empty objects give zero groups. -/
