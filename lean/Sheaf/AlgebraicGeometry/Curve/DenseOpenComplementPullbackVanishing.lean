/-- A sheaf pushed forward from the closed complement of a dense open in a curve
has no positive cohomology after restriction along an open immersion.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0GJA, proof and remark (d).
(blueprint: lem-pbc-k2-dense-open-complement-pullback-vanishing)

Proof: The finite-type curve X is Noetherian. Its finitely many irreducible components
have generic points, all in the dense open U. Every chain of two distinct points in the
closed complement would extend upward to a generic point outside the complement,
contradicting dimension at most one. Thus the complement has dimension at most zero.
A closed immersion is a homeomorphism onto its range, so Z is zero-dimensional,
Noetherian and of finite type over k. It has finitely many points, all closed, whose
residue fields are k by the algebraically closed Nullstellensatz. Its reduction is a
finite disjoint union of copies of Spec k. Nilpotent invariance identifies its etale
site with that of its reduction; sheaves there have no positive cohomology.
For a:W -> X open, form Z_W = W times_X Z. This is an open subscheme of Z, hence
again a finite disjoint union of algebraically closed points after reduction.
Direct image along the closed immersion i is exact, and it commutes with open
restriction: on an etale V over W both sides evaluate G on V times_X Z.
Forgetting module coefficients commutes with this direct image, and inverse image
commutes with forgetting. Finite exact direct image and the global-sections
comparison identify the displayed cohomology with that of G restricted to Z_W,
which vanishes in positive degrees. Empty complements and empty W give the zero
sheaf; neither torsion nor constructibility is needed. -/
