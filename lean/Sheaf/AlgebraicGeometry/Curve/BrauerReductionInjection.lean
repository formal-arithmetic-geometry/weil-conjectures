/-- Pullback to the reduction is injective on the cohomological Brauer group of a curve.
Source: literature/blueprint/master/blueprint/sec-curve-estimates/sk-prop-h2/
lem-sc-brauer-zero-all-curves.md, Proof, Step 1 and the following Claim.
(blueprint: lem-sc-brauer-reduction-injection)

Proof: finite type over a field makes C Noetherian, so its coherent nilradical N has
N^m = 0 for some m. For every affine etale V over C, flatness identifies the pullback of
N with the ideal of V_red, since an etale scheme over C_red is reduced. Lifting units
modulo a nilpotent ideal gives the exact sequence
1 → 1 + N → G_m,C → i_* G_m,C_red → 1 for i : C_red → C.
For j ≥ 1 the map 1 + a ↦ a identifies (1 + N^j)/(1 + N^(j+1)) with the additive
quasi-coherent sheaf (N^j/N^(j+1))_et: the cross term ab lies in N^(j+1).
Every quasi-coherent etale sheaf on C has zero H^q for q ≥ 2. Indeed a finite affine
cover has affine intersections by separatedness; affine etale vanishing and the Cech
spectral sequence identify etale cohomology with Zariski cohomology, which vanishes
above the dimension of the Noetherian scheme C. Descending induction from N^m = 0,
using the long exact sequences of this filtration, gives H^2(C, 1 + N) = 0.
The long exact sequence for units therefore injects H^2(C, G_m) into
H^2(C, i_* G_m,C_red). Exact finite pushforward identifies the latter with
H^2(C_red, G_m). The resulting map is the canonical pullback written below.
This also covers reduced, zero-dimensional, disconnected and empty curves. -/
