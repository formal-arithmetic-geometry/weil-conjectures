/-- Degree-zero Picard divisibility for a proper smooth curve.
Source: blueprint `lem-sc-pic-proper-ntorsion`, the Jacobian calculation.
(blueprint: lem-sc-pic-proper-ntorsion-div)

Proof in words: Smoothness gives local Noetherianity and regularity, so connectedness
makes C integral. Over the algebraically closed (hence separably closed) field,
connectedness gives geometric connectedness; smoothness then gives geometric
irreducibility and geometric reducedness, hence geometric integrality. The dimension-one
hypothesis and smoothness give smooth relative dimension one. Jacobian representability
therefore applies to the proper curve and identifies its degree-zero Picard subgroup
with the rational points of a proper, smooth, geometrically integral commutative group
scheme J. These properties make J an abelian variety. The subgroup used by the Jacobian
is the kernel of the degree homomorphism, whose underlying set is f.picZero.
The hypothesis `(n : k) ≠ 0` excludes n = 0, hence n is positive. Clause (d) of the
abelian-variety estimate says the nth-power map on the Jacobian's rational points is
surjective. For a degree-zero class L, take an nth root of its image in the Jacobian and
transport that root back along the group equivalence. It is a degree-zero class M;
the homomorphism property and injectivity of the equivalence give M ^ n = L.
For n = 1 one can take M = L. -/
