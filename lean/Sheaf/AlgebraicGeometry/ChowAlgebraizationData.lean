/-- Algebraization on a supplied quasi-projective proper modification, with proper
support of the pushforward.

Source: Stacks Project, Theorem 088E, projective compactification and support paragraphs,
using Lemmas 0885 and 0887.
(blueprint: new-chow-algebraization-data).

Proof: The supplied immersion e, and the equation he over Spec A, give the required
quasi-projective structure on Y. Properness of q and Noetherianity of Z imply Y is
Noetherian. Thus e is quasi-compact. Its scheme-theoretic image in the supplied finite
projective space is a closed subscheme Y', projective over A, and e factors as an open
immersion j : Y → Y' followed by the closed immersion into that projective space.
Pull G back termwise along q. FormalSystemsPullback gives coherence and compatibility
with the powers and quotient transitions of Q.comap q, which hQ identifies with I O_Y.
The finite-type support pullback equality and Nakayama identify every term's support
with q⁻¹ Supp(G₀). This closed set is proper over A by properness of q and hR.
Its image under j is closed in the separated scheme Y' and proper over A.
Extend each pulled term by j_*: on j(Y) it is the original coherent term, and on the
complement of its closed support it is zero. These two opens cover Y'; coherence and
the formal quotient compatibility can be checked there. The extension therefore defines
a coherent formal I O_Y' system. Apply projective existence to the closed embedding of
Y' into the projective space specified by e, obtaining a coherent F' and its completion
isomorphism. The support of F' outside j(Y) is closed in the proper Y', so its image in
Spec A is closed. If nonempty, it meets V(I), since completeness puts I in the Jacobson
radical. At a point over V(I), Nakayama identifies support of F' with that of F'/IF',
which is the extended degree-zero term and has support contained in j(Y). This excludes
boundary support. Restrict F' along j to obtain F and restrict the completion isomorphism;
the pullback/completion comparison identifies it with the requested system isomorphism.
The support of F is proper over A because it is the support of F' transported into Y.
Proper coherent pushforward along q is coherent, with support contained in the closed
image of this support. That image is proper over A, and its closed subsets are proper,
which proves the asserted proper support of q_*F. The construction uses e and he to
obtain Y'; it does not presume a projective compactification for an arbitrary proper q. -/
