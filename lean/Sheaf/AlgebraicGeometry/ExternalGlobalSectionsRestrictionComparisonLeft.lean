Proof: Write P = X times Y and p, q for its projections. For V open in X, put
W = p inverse-image V. The unit F -> p_* p^* F sends F(V) to sections of p^* F
on W. The unit G -> q_* q^* G sends G(Y) to sections on q inverse-image Y = P;
restrict these sections to W. Tensor the two sections on W. Naturality of the
units and the restriction formula for tensor sections make this operation bilinear
over k and compatible with every inclusion of opens V' into V. Tensor induction
therefore assembles it into a presheaf morphism c. At V = X, restriction along
preimage_top is exactly tensorPullbackTopSection in both factors, so its component
followed by externalSectionsTopIsoLeft is externalGlobalSectionsTensor.
For any V, the cartesian open-immersion square identifies V times Y with W.
The restriction section isomorphism identifies F(V) with Gamma(V,F restricted),
including the k-action induced by V -> X -> Spec k. Tensoring this isomorphism
with Gamma(Y,G) gives eS. Identify restriction of the external coefficient to W
with its pullback along W -> P using the unique left-adjoint comparison carrying
the restriction unit to the chosen tensor-pullback unit. The tensor-pullback
comparison and the two composition comparisons identify this coefficient with
p_V^*(F restricted) tensor q_V^*G on V times Y; taking sections gives eT.
The unit equations for the restriction and composition comparisons identify the
first pulled-back section with the pullback of its restriction to V and the second
with the pullback of the unchanged section of G. The tensor comparison sends their
pure tensor section to the tensor of these sections. Thus the component square
commutes on pure tensors and, by tensor induction, on all tensors. No cover or
bijectivity hypothesis is used; empty opens and zero coefficients give the same
unit and tensor equations.
