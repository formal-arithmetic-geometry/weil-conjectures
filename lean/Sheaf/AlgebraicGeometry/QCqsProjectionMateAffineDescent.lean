/-- The projection-mate theorem for affine targets implies its global case.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 08EU, first sentence of the proof.
(blueprint: lem-pc-qcqs-projection-mate-affine-descent).

Proof: cover Y by affine opens V, each identified with Spec Gamma(V,O).
The inverse image U is quasi-compact since f is quasi-compact and V is affine,
and it is quasi-separated since X is quasi-separated. Restriction is exact
and is a localization whose derived direct-image right adjoint is fully
faithful. Pullback and tensor commute with open restriction and direct image
commutes with restriction on the target. Thus both bifunctors compared by t
factor through these localizations. Evaluate t on the fully faithful right
adjoints and use the invertible localization counits to descend the supplied
tensor comparison. Transport the supplied adjunction by the same procedure.
The restricted displayed Hom-equivalence mate is precisely this transported
mate, by the counit formula for the Hom equivalence. Change chosen derived
localizations to standard ones by their canonical localization equivalences;
these equivalences transport the K-flat tensor, pullback, direct image, t and
p. Transport also across V isomorphic to Spec Gamma(V,O). Apply haffine and
reflect invertibility through these equivalences. Restriction preserves
quasi-coherent cohomology. Finally exact restriction commutes with cohomology,
and isomorphisms of cohomology sheaves are detected on the affine open cover,
so the original mate is invertible. For empty Y the cover is empty and all
cohomology sheaves are zero, giving the same conclusion. -/
