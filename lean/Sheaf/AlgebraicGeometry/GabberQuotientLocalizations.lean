/-- Every prime localization of a quotient of a normal domain with separably closed
fraction field is strictly henselian.

Source: Stacks Project, Etale Cohomology, Lemma 09ZC, second sentence of the proof;
Algebra, Lemma 05WS.

Proof: For a prime `p` of `R/I`, let `P` be its preimage in `R`. Then `R_P` is a normal
local domain and has the same fraction field as `R`. Stacks 09Z9 makes it henselian
with separably closed residue field. The localized quotient map identifies `(R/I)_p`
with `R_P / I R_P`. Since `I` is contained in `P`, its extension lies in the maximal
ideal of `R_P`. Apply the strictly henselian quotient theorem (05WS) and transfer
strict henselianity along the displayed ring isomorphism. If `I` is the unit ideal,
there are no primes of `R/I`, so the assertion is vacuous.
