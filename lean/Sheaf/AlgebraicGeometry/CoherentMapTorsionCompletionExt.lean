/-- Completion and composition with a map having power-torsion kernel detect maps.
Only the kernel of b needs a bound; its cokernel plays no role.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0889, uniqueness argument, and Tag 088A, final paragraph
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-coherent-map-torsion-completion-ext).

Proof: choose a positive exponent where the kernel of b embeds into the quotient
of Q by that ideal power. This finite-level separation follows from Artin--Rees
on a finite affine cover, since the kernel is annihilated by a power of K.
The difference f-g factors through the kernel of b. Equality of completion maps
implies equality of their components at the chosen exponent. Precomposing that
component equality with the source quotient projection shows that f-g maps to
zero in the quotient of Q. Cancel the monomorphic map from the kernel to that
quotient: the factor is zero, so f-g is zero and f=g. For K the unit ideal,
the kernel is zero; for K zero, the quotient is Q. The empty scheme has only
zero maps.
