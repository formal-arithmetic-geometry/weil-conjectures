Proof: Regard W intersect V as the inverse-image open U in V. Its inclusion into the
ambient overlap is a scheme isomorphism. Quasi-separatedness makes the intersection of
the compact opens W and V compact; the homeomorphism makes U compact. The inverse image
of T in V is closed. Its complement is compact because it identifies with the intersection
of V and the compact open complement of T. Restrict F from W to the overlap. Restriction
of strictly perfect local models proves perfectness there, and exactness and the stalk
comparison prove support on the pullback of T. Transport this object to U and apply
exists_perfect_supported_extension on the affine scheme V.toScheme. Transport the resulting
restriction isomorphism back through the scheme isomorphism. Exact restriction preserves
biproducts and commutes with shifts, identifying its stabilized target with the displayed
restriction of F plus F[1]. The same comparisons give the stated support on V. Empty
opens and T are covered by the extension theorem and the zero restriction categories. -/
