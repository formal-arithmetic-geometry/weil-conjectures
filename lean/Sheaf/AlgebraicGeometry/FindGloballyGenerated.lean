/-- A nonempty affine open with finite complement in an integral separated Noetherian
one-dimensional scheme is the nonvanishing locus of a section of a globally generated
invertible module. Source: Stacks Project, Varieties Lemma 09NB
(blueprint: lem-sc-find-globally-generated).

Proof:
1. Write `U = Spec A` and `K = k(X)`. At each point `xᵢ` of the finite complement,
   `Bᵢ = O_{X,xᵢ}` is Noetherian by `pqf-def-locnoeth`, the affine-stalk localization
   description `lem-weil-pbc-spec-domain-stalks-function-field`, and
   `lem-weil-pbc-localization-noetherian`. Its dimension is one by
   `lem-sc-scheme-stalk-dimension-generalization-chains`: dimension is at most one,
   and the generic point in `U` gives a strict specialization to `xᵢ`.
   The pullback of `U` to `Spec Bᵢ` is `Spec K`. Embed `A` and `Bᵢ` in `K` using
   `lem-sc-integral-scheme-stalks-in-function-field`; separatedness gives surjectivity
   of `A ⊗ Bᵢ → K` by `lem-sc-separated-affine-function-field-surjective`.
2. Each `Bᵢ` is a one-dimensional local domain with fraction field `K`, by
   `lem-sc-integral-scheme-stalks-in-function-field`. The fraction field of `A` is
   `K` by `lem-sc-integral-function-field-affine-fraction`. Apply
   `lem-sc-jacobson-denominator-function-field` to find nonzero `f ∈ A` with
   `f⁻¹ ∈ mᵢ` for every complement point.
3. Choose neighbourhoods `Uᵢ` where `f⁻¹` is regular. Together with `U` they cover `X`.
   On `U ∩ Uᵢ`, the functions `f` and `f⁻¹` are inverse units by the injectivity into
   `K` from `lem-sc-integral-scheme-stalks-in-function-field`; on `Uᵢ ∩ Uⱼ` use `1`.
4. These transition functions satisfy the cocycle identities and glue the trivial
   modules to an invertible module `L` by `lem-sc-glue-component-transition-cocycle`.
   The local sections `1` on `U`, `f⁻¹` on `Uᵢ` glue to `s`; the local sections `f`
   on `U`, `1` on `Uᵢ` glue to `t`.
5. The section `s` is nonvanishing on `U` and vanishes at each complement point,
   so its nonvanishing locus equals `U`. The section `t` is nonvanishing on every
   `Uᵢ`. Thus `s` and `t` generate `L` at every point, giving global generation.
