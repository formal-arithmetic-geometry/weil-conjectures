/-- On a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme, the perfect objects of `D_QCoh(𝒪_X)`
have a set of representatives up to isomorphism.
Source: Stacks Project, Derived Categories of Schemes,
Theorem perfect-theorem-bondal-van-den-Bergh, set-of-representatives input
(blueprint: lem-pc-perfect-complexes-compact-set).

Proof:
1. On an affine open `W = Spec A`, `lem-pc-perfect-affine-bounded-projective` (Tag 08EB)
represents every perfect object by a bounded complex of finite projective `A`-modules.
Each finite projective module is a direct summand of a finite free module, hence is
isomorphic to a submodule of some `A^n`. The finite ranges of degrees, these submodules,
and the linear differentials form a set. Isomorphic complexes give isomorphic derived
objects, yielding a set of representatives on `W`.
2. For `W = U ∪ V`, with `U` quasi-compact and `V` affine, assume sets of perfect
representatives on `U`, `V`, and `U ∩ V`. Restrictions remain perfect by
`def-pc-perfect-complex`. The quasi-compact opens of a qcqs scheme meet the hypotheses
of `lem-pc-derived-mayer-vietoris-triangle`: its other two terms are the direct sum
of the derived direct images from `U` and `V`, and the derived direct image from `U ∩ V`.
Choose representatives of the three restrictions and transport the second triangle map
along their isomorphisms. For each triple the possible maps form a set. The original
object is a cocone of such a map, unique up to isomorphism by TR3 and the five lemma.
Thus perfect objects on `W` have a set of representatives. Apply
`lem-sc-invert-s-cohomology-induction` to the affine case and this gluing step. -/
