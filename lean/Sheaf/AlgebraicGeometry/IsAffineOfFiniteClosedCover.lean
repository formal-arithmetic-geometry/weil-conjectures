/-- A scheme covered set theoretically by finitely many affine closed subschemes is affine.
Source: Stacks Project, Limits, Lemma 32.11.3 (Tag 09NL)
(blueprint: lem-sc-closed-affine-union-affine).

Proof:
1. If `r = 0`, the covering hypothesis makes `Y` empty, hence the spectrum of the zero ring
   and affine [def-weil-affine-spectrum].
2. The disjoint union `W` of the `Z j` is affine, as a finite coproduct of affine schemes
   [lem-weil-pbc-affine-morphism-permanence, clause 4].
3. Each closed immersion is finite [lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersion-finite]. Inductively,
   the induced map `W → Y` is finite by [lem-weil-pbc-finite-coproduct], hence satisfies
   [def-weil-finite-integral-morphism].
4. This map is surjective because its image is the union of the images of the `i j`
   [def-weil-surjective-morphism]. Finiteness implies universal closedness
   [lem-weil-pbc-finite-closed-map-finite-fibres, clause 1; def-weil-proper-morphism].
5. A surjective universally closed morphism with affine source has affine target
   [lem-weil-pbc-surjective-universally-closed-affine-target] (Stacks, Proposition 05YU).
