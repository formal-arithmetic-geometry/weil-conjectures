/-- The canonical sectionwise annihilator of a constructible module sheaf with finite

Proof: Choose the finite module-constructible stratification. On each stratum discard
empty members of a trivializing etale cover. Identify each remaining constant value
with a geometric stalk, using a separably closed extension of the residue field of a
point of the member and inverse-image/stalk compatibility; it is finite by hypothesis.
Noetherian strata are quasi-compact, so choose finitely many cover members. Intersect
annihilators of these finitely many finite modules. This intersection equals the ideal
of scalars killing every section, the intersection of all section-module annihilators:
geometric stalks detect zero scalar endomorphisms, and constant values are stalks.
The quotient by this canonical ideal embeds into the finite
product of their endomorphism rings, so is finite. The ideal kills all geometric stalks
on all strata and hence the sheaf, as geometric stalks detect equality. In particular
it kills every section, on arbitrary etale objects, not just quasi-compact ones.
For the empty scheme use the unit ideal and empty
stratification. For the zero sheaf the quotient can likewise be the zero ring. -/
