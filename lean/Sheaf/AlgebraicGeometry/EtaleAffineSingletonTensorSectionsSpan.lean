Proof: write A = Γ(U,O), B = Γ(W,O), and M = Γ(U,U*F). Induct on the nonzero
number n+1 of factors, using the binary affine fibre-product spectrum formula and its
projection equations. This identifies the affine product P with the spectrum of the
indexed tensor product of the copies of B over A, with the projection pullbacks equal
to the indexed tensor inclusions. Compare tensor pullback U*F with ordinary pullback
by uniqueness of left adjoints to pushforward, and transport quasi-coherence along
this isomorphism. Apply the affine pullback sections formula to P→U and U*F.
Compose with the unit-normalized pullback composition isomorphism to identify the
iterated pullback with P*F. Tensoring the ring identification with M gives an additive
equivalence from M tensor the indexed tensor product to Γ(P,P*F). On pure tensors,
the affine sections formula multiplies the function by the unit-pulled coefficient;
the projection equations and unit normalization give the displayed generators.
Every tensor is a sum of pure tensors. Indexed tensor induction expresses the second
factor as sums of scalar multiples of tprod(b); move each scalar to M by balancing.
Thus every section is a sum of displayed generators, so their additive subgroup
closure is the whole group. For n=0 this is the ordinary affine sections formula.
Empty affine schemes and zero coefficient modules are covered by the construction.
