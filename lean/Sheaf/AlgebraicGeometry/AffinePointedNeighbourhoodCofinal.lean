/-- The full subcategory of affine pointed étale neighbourhoods of a geometric point is
initial; its opposite inclusion is final, so computes the same opposite-indexed stalk colimit.
Source: blueprint `sk-prop-h2` (blueprint: lemma-weil-pbc-affine-neighbourhood-cofinal),
Stacks Project, proof of Tag 04HX and the dual of Tag 0BUC, with Tag 04E7.

Proof:
1. For each pointed neighbourhood, choose an affine open containing its geometric point
   and lift the point to that open. Its inclusion is a point-preserving refinement
   (`lem-weil-pbc-pointed-etale-neighbourhood-affine-shrink`), so each comma category
   of affine neighbourhoods mapping to a fixed neighbourhood is nonempty.
2. Given two comma objects, cofilteredness of the ambient pointed neighbourhood category
   (`lem-weil-pbc-pointed-etale-neighbourhoods-cofiltered`) gives a common refinement.
   Equalize its two composites to the fixed neighbourhood, then shrink the resulting
   refinement to an affine open as in step 1. Fullness gives arrows from this affine
   comma object to both original comma objects, hence a connecting zigzag. Thus every
   comma category is connected, and the inclusion is initial
   (`lem-weil-pbc-colimit-initial-full-subcategory`).
3. Passing to opposites makes the inclusion final. The final-functor colimit comparison
   identifies the affine-indexed colimit with the full stalk colimit
   (`lem-weil-pbc-colimit-initial-full-subcategory`). -/
