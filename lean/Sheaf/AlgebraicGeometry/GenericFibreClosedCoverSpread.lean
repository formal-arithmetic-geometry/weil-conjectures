/-- Two closed subsets covering a fibre cover the family over a neighbourhood in
its base point's closure.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 054Y (Lemma 37.24.5), applied after the reduction to the
integral base in Tag 055N, proof, first two paragraphs.

Proof: give the closure of `y` its reduced induced closed subscheme structure Z,
using the vanishing ideal construction. Its inclusion j is a closed embedding,
and its range is the closure of y. This space is irreducible and the scheme is
reduced, so it is integral. The point η of Z over y specializes to every point of Z.
Base change g along j to a finite type morphism f. Generic flatness (Tag 052A)
gives a nonempty open U of Z on which f is flat. Since η specializes to every
point, U contains η. Express U as the inverse image of an ambient open V in T;
then V contains y. For x mapping into V intersected with the closure of y, lift
x to a point w of the pullback, whose image lies in U. Flatness lifts the
generalization from η to f(w), giving a point a over η specializing to w.
Projecting a to P gives a point of the original fibre over y, hence of C union D.
The projection of a specializes to x. Since C union D is closed, it contains x.
An empty generic fibre causes no exception: the same lifting argument shows
there can be no such x.
