/-- A scheme unramified over a field has discrete underlying topological space.
Source: Stacks Project, Morphisms, Lemma 02G7 (lemma-unramified-over-field), part (1)
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-unramified-over-field-discrete).

Proof: On every pair of affine opens mapped into one another, local finite type gives
`Algebra.FiniteType` on the section rings. The open diagonal gives formal unramifiedness
of the morphism and hence `Algebra.FormallyUnramified` on those rings. Mathlib's instance
in `RingTheory.Unramified.LocalStructure` gives `Algebra.QuasiFinite`, establishing
Mathlib's `LocallyQuasiFinite g` directly. Since a field is Artinian, its spectrum is
locally Artinian. Apply `IsLocallyArtinian.of_locallyQuasiFinite g` to obtain that `Y`
is locally Artinian, then the instance `IsLocallyArtinian.discreteTopology`. This is
an implementation of the locally quasi-finite route in Stacks 02G7 using Mathlib's
Artinian-scheme results; no comparison with the project's quasi-finiteness predicate
or transport through the scheme-theoretic fibre is needed. -/
