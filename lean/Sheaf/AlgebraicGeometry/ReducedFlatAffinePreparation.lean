/-- Prepare a reduced affine flat family over an integral affine base, before any
purely inseparable extension.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0559, second proof, reduction and first flat shrinking;
Tags 051T and 052A.
Proof: factor f through the given affine open V. Reduce X and V; the morphism
from the reduced source factors through the reduction of V. The latter is
integral since its underlying space has the generic point induced by eta.
Both reduction maps are surjective closed immersions. The canonical map from
the reduced source into the pullback along the base reduction is also a
surjective closed immersion: on rings, if A maps to B, then
B tensor_A (A / nilradical A) = B / ((nilradical A) B), and its reduction is
B / nilradical B. Apply generic flat finite presentation to this reduced
family, which is quasi-compact since both schemes are affine. Choose a
principal open about the generic point inside the resulting nonempty open.
Lift its defining element from the reduced coordinate ring to the coordinate
ring of V. It defines an affine open U in T, whose inverse image in the
reduced base is the chosen principal open S. Restrict the reduced source to S,
obtaining affine reduced Z, flat and locally finitely presented over S.
Restriction preserves the universal homeomorphism to the original pullback.
The homeomorphism from S to U lifts eta to its generic point. No geometric
irreducibility assumption or extension of the generic residue field is used.
The generic-point hypothesis excludes an empty base; an empty source is allowed.
