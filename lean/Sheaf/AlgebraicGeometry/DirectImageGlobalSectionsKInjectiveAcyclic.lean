/-- Direct image of a K-injective complex is acyclic for subsequent global sections.
No preservation of K-injectivity by direct image is asserted.

(blueprint: lem-pc-direct-image-global-sections-kinjective-acyclic).

Proof: let p_Y be the morphism to the one-point ringed space with ring Γ(Y,O_Y).
Apply the successive-direct-image acyclicity statement
lem-pc-ringed-space-direct-image-kinjective-acyclic to f and p_Y, using the standard
model of the derived category on the point if needed. Modules on that point are
Γ(Y,O_Y)-modules, and evaluation on the point is an exact equivalence. The underived
identification of p_Y direct image followed by evaluation with global sections is
the identity on sections and their scalar action. Right-derived uniqueness transports
this identification and its units through the exact equivalence. Thus the unit for
global sections at f_*I is the image of the invertible unit for p_Y direct image at
f_*I, conjugated by the localization factorization isomorphisms. Functors preserve
isomorphisms, so the displayed unit is invertible. This works for unbounded I and
arbitrary f: acyclicity, rather than K-injectivity of f_*I, is what is transported. -/
