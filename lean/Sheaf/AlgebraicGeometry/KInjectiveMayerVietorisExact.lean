/-- The concrete restriction/direct-image diagram is short exact for a cover and
an arbitrary complex with injective terms. K-injectivity is not needed here.
Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology, Tag 08BV (lemma-exact-sequence-j-star),
last paragraph; Tag 01EB (lemma-mayer-vietoris), first paragraph of its proof.
(blueprint: lem-pc-kinjective-mayer-vietoris-exact).

Proof: The transported underived adjunction is the restriction/direct-image
adjunction. On sections over a test open T its unit is restriction from T to
T ∩ U. For W ⊆ U, the mate of the restricted counit is restriction from
T ∩ U to T ∩ W: transpose this sectionwise restriction along the adjunction,
where the inverse composition comparison restricts twice, the counit removes
the repeated U-restriction, and the forward comparison identifies the result
with restriction to W. Thus in degree n the two arrows are the pair of
restrictions and their difference. The two opens T ∩ U and T ∩ V cover T.
Sheaf uniqueness makes the first arrow injective. A pair killed by the
second arrow agrees on the intersection, so sheaf gluing gives a preimage
under the first arrow. For an intersection section, use
injective_restriction_surjective on T ∩ U ∩ V ⊆ T ∩ U for I.X n,
and take zero in the V component. Hence the second arrow is surjective.
The sectionwise calculation gives the kernel universal property for the
first arrow in presheaf modules. Since all three terms are sheaves and their
inclusion into presheaf modules is fully faithful, this remains a kernel
universal property for sheaves. The first arrow is monic by sectionwise
injectivity, and the second is epic by sectionwise surjectivity. Finally apply
HomologicalComplex.shortExact_of_degreewise_shortExact. Empty or repeated
opens require no separate argument: the same sheaf gluing and lifting work. -/
