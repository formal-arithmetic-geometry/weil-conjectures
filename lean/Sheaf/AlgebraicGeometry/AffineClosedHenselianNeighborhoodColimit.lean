/-- A closed affine pair admits a henselian neighborhood whose cohomology is computed
by a small filtered system of etale neighborhoods. Torsion is not needed here.

Proof: Write X = Spec B and Z = Spec (B/K), using affineness of a closed subscheme.
Apply pair_henselization to (B,K). Choose a small skeleton of the essentially small
filtered category, then a cofinal directed preorder. Its ring colimit A is henselian
along L = KA, and the quotient map B/K to A/L is an isomorphism. On spectra its
inverse gives e; the structure map t satisfies the displayed triangle. Pull J back
to each neighborhood and to Spec A. Compose inverse images to obtain the compatible
sheaf diagram and the cohomology diagram H. Continuity for spectra of filtered ring
colimits identifies its colimit with cohomology of the pullback to Spec A. Commuting
module pullback with forgetting coefficients identifies the stage and limit groups
with the groups in the statement. Take the resulting colimit cocone c. Essential
smallness and cofinality ensure that the index has universe u. The quotient
isomorphism gives the triangle, including for K = B (empty closed fibre) and K = 0.
