/-- Direct image has support inside the given closed ambient support.
Source: Stacks Project, Lemma 0CYJ, proof (vanishing on the complement).
(blueprint: new-closed-support-pushforward-support)

Proof: At a point outside T, shrink each representative of a direct-image stalk
section to the complement of T. Its sections are sections of F on the inverse image.
Every stalk there is zero by the support hypothesis; the sheaf section extensionality
lemma makes each such section zero. Every germ at the original point is therefore zero.
This also covers empty schemes, empty supports and zero modules. -/
