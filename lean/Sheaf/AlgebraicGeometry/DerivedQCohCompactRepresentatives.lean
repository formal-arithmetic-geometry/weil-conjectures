/-- Compact objects in the quasi-coherent derived category are perfect.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 09M1, converse direction of
`perfect-proposition-compact-is-perfect`; restriction to affine opens and the
finite-projective criterion reduce compactness to perfectness.
(blueprint: lem-sc-derived-qcoh-compact-is-perfect)
Proof: Use the existing perfect supported generator with empty excluded open to obtain
an explicit generator telescope for P. Compactness factors the identity through a finite
thick construction from that generator. Perfectness is closed under shifts, triangles
and retracts, so the ambient thick envelope consists of perfect objects. The retract
closure is derived from the split-triangle biproduct decomposition, and the zero object
is a retract of the perfect generator. This route does not require comparing open models. -/

/-- Compact objects of the quasi-coherent derived category have small representatives.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 09M1 and 09IS, and the set-of-representatives argument
of `lem-pc-perfect-complexes-compact-set`.
(blueprint: lem-sc-derived-qcoh-compact-representatives).

Proof: Noetherian schemes are quasi-compact and quasi-separated. First work in
small-Hom derived models on X and on all its opens: K-injective resolutions give
these models and localization equivalences to the supplied derived category.
Compact objects are perfect by Tag 09M1: restriction to an affine open preserves
compactness since its right adjoint commutes with sums, and the affine module
criterion identifies compact objects with bounded finite-projective complexes.
Perfect complexes have a universe-u set of representatives: on affines encode
bounded finite-projective complexes by summands of finite free modules and their
matrices; glue across a finite affine cover using Mayer-Vietoris triangles and
small Hom sets. Every representative is compact by perfectObjectCompact.
Transport the representatives and their isomorphisms back along the localization
equivalence. Its additive Hom equivalences and preservation of coproducts identify
the compactness comparison maps, so compactness is preserved and reflected.
The zero object is included, including when X is empty; no nonempty indexing type
is assumed. All choices occur inside an existence theorem, not in a definition. -/
