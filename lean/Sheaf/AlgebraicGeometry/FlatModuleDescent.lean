/-- A finitely presented quasi-coherent module whose limit pullback is flat over the base
is flat over every sufficiently late base.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 05LY (blueprint: lem-pc-flat-module-descent).

Proof:
1. Cover the finitely presented source by finitely many affine opens
   (`lem-weil-pbc-qcqs-finite-affine-open-cover`). Their rings are finitely presented over
   the stage ring (`lem-weil-pbc-lfp-affine-opens-finite-presentation`), and the chart modules
   are finitely presented (`def-sc-finitely-presented-module`, Stacks Tag 01PC).
   Base change identifies the pulled-back charts and modules with tensor products
   (`def-pc-base-change`). Limit flatness implies flatness of their sections (Tag 01U4).
2. Apply `lem-pc-affine-flat-module-descent` to each chart with its base algebra equal to
   the stage ring. Directedness gives a common upper bound of `i` and the finitely many
   stages; when the affine cover is empty, take `i` itself.
3. For every later stage, all chart modules are flat over that stage's base ring.
   The affine-local criterion (Tag 01U4) glues these conclusions to the whole source.

The ring functor presents the affine inverse system contravariantly. The cone supplies
its limit projections. An affine limit is written as `IsAffine c.pt`, allowing any choice
of its isomorphism with a spectrum; affine stages are quasi-compact and quasi-separated,
and all their transition morphisms are affine. -/
