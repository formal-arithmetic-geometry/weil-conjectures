/-- Supply the auxiliary adjunction required by finite derived duality. This asserts
only an adjoint to derived restriction of algebra scalars; it makes no assertion about
f's right adjoint, its degree-zero representative, or its counit.

(blueprint: lem-sc-finite-restriction-derived-right-adjoint).

Proof:
1. Apply `exists_affine_derivedSheafHom_adjunction` to f. This supplies the derived
   sheaf-Hom functor H, the left functor T, the adjunction T |- H, and a natural
   isomorphism Q ⋙ T ≅ restrictScalars.mapHomologicalComplex ⋙ Q.
2. Restriction of scalars is exact: kernels and cokernels retain their underlying
   abelian sheaves, with the restricted action. The finite-limit and finite-colimit
   clauses of `derivedRHomAlgebraModule` apply to the algebra sheaf f_* O_X.
   Consequently its termwise functor descends to mapDerivedCategory.
3. Compose the factorization isomorphism of mapDerivedCategory with the inverse
   of T's factorization. Full faithfulness of precomposition by the localization Q
   descends this to T ≅ restrictScalars.mapDerivedCategory. The exact-functor
   comparison `rightDerivedFunctorIsoMapDerivedCategory` identifies the latter
   with restrictScalars.rightDerivedFunctor.
4. Transport T |- H along this natural isomorphism (`Adjunction.ofNatIsoLeft`).
   Its right adjoint H is the required witness. This does not require a nonempty
   scheme, nonzero algebra, finite rank, or Noetherianity. -/
