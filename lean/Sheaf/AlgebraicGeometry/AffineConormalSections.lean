/-- The tensor pullback of the ideal of a closed immersion is quasi-coherent, and its
sections on the inverse image of an affine open are canonically `I/I²`.
The affine coordinates are supplied by `r : R ≃+* Γ(X, U)`. The hypothesis on `I` says that
`Z ∩ U = Spec(R/I)` over `U`: for a closed immersion this is equivalent to
`I = ker((i.app U) ∘ r)`.
The target is written as sections of the pushforward, whose scalar action is restriction
along `i.app U`; its underlying group is exactly the conormal sections over `i ⁻¹ᵁ U`.
The equation on ideal sections pins the equivalence to the canonical map `a mod I² ↦ i* a`.
Semilinearity along `r` expresses `R`-linearity in these coordinates. Since `(i.app U) ∘ r`
is surjective with kernel `I`, the equivalence is also `R/I`-linear.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-affine-conormal-sections).
Proof, following the node's five steps:
1. By def-sbc-closed-immersion-ideal-sheaf and
   lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersion-affine-cover-criterion, the inverse image of `U` is affine,
   its section ring is `R/I`, and the ideal sheaf on `U` is the associated module of `I`.
2. By lem-weil-pbc-module-pullback-quasi-coherent, pulling this quasi-coherent ideal sheaf
   back along `i` gives a quasi-coherent conormal sheaf (pqf-def-coherent).
3. By lem-weil-pbc-module-pullback-affine-sections, the canonical section map identifies
   these conormal sections with `I ⊗[R] (R/I)`; it sends `a ⊗ 1` to the pullback of `a`.
4. By lem-weil-pbc-tensor-over-quotient-ring and the tensor swap, this tensor product is
   `I/I²`, via `a ⊗ r̄ ↦ ra mod I²`. Both sides are annihilated by `I`, so this is also
   an `R/I`-linear equivalence.
5. Compose the inverse of the equivalence in step 4 with that in step 3. Its value on
   `a mod I²` is the tensor-pullback unit on the ideal section `a`, giving the displayed
   equation and the canonical identification, independently of any choices. -/
