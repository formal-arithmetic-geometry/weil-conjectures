/-- For every scheme `X`, the derived category of `𝒪_X`-modules whose cohomology
sheaves are quasi-coherent has all set-indexed direct sums.
Source: literature/stacks-project/derived-categories-of-schemes.tex,
  Lemma perfect-lemma-quasi-coherence-direct-sums
(blueprint: lem-pc-derived-qcoh-direct-sums). The proof proceeds as follows. First,
by `lem-pc-derived-ambient-direct-sums`, the ambient derived category has
set-indexed coproducts represented by termwise sums, with cohomology the direct
sum of the cohomologies in each degree. Second, for a family of quasi-coherent
cohomology sheaves, express its direct sum as the filtered colimit of its finite
partial sums; `lem-weil-pbc-quasi-coherent-module-direct-sum` handles finite sums,
including the zero sum, and
`lem-weil-pbc-quasi-coherent-module-colimit-affine-sections` handles the filtered
colimit. Thus every cohomology sheaf of the ambient coproduct is quasi-coherent.
Finally, the ambient coproduct universal-property bijection restricts to the full
subcategory `schemeDerivedQCohCategory`, proving the asserted coproducts there,
including empty and singleton families. -/
