/-- For any target module, Hom out of a coherent source is locally a kernel between finite
sums of the target. No coherence assumption on the target is needed.

Source: Stacks Project, Modules, Lemma 01BW (lemma-coherent-finite-presentation),
Lemma 01CQ (lemma-internal-hom-locally-kernel-direct-sum), and the proof of Lemma 01CP.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-coherent-hom-local-kernel).

Proof:
1. At `x`, finite type of `G` gives a finite free epimorphism on a neighbourhood `W`.
Coherence makes its kernel finite type. Shrink to a neighbourhood `U` on which that
kernel has finitely many generators. Restricting the first map and composing the
second free epimorphism with the kernel inclusion gives a finite free right exact
presentation of `G` on `U` (01BW).
2. Restriction of the internal Hom to `U` is the internal Hom of the restrictions:
on every smaller open both consist of the same module morphisms, and restriction
and scalar multiplication agree (Sites, Modules, Lemma 0E8H).
3. Precomposition with the presentation is left exact (01CO). Hom out of the finite
free terms is a finite sum of copies of the restricted target, by evaluation on basis
sections. Transport the sequence along these isomorphisms. Its initial map identifies
the restricted Hom with the kernel of the transported next map (01CQ). The ranks may
be zero; the same universal properties apply to the empty sums. -/
