/-- Every object on an open admits an extended test object on the ambient scheme,
from which restriction is bijective on Hom sets, also after tensoring.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 00A7, 08BT and 06YB.
(blueprint: lem-sc-derived-open-tensor-test-objects).

Proof: let J be exact extension by zero, transported through Modules.overEquiv and
then derived using the exact-functor localization adjunction. For A take B = J(A).
The unit A → R(B) is invertible since restriction of extension by zero is the
identity, including for the empty open. The adjunction and this unit identify
restriction on Hom(B,E) with a bijection for every E. The counit J(R(C)) → C is an
isomorphism whenever C has zero cohomology stalks outside U: inside U its restriction
is invertible by the triangle identity, and outside U both stalk cohomologies vanish.
This applies to B and B tensor L. Indeed represent L by a K-flat complex; B has zero
stalk cohomology outside U, and the stalkwise K-flat tensor calculation gives the
same vanishing for B tensor L. Thus B tensor L is also in the essential image of J,
and the same adjunction proves bijectivity of restriction on Hom(B tensor L,E).
No boundedness, finite presentation, or quasi-compactness is used. -/
