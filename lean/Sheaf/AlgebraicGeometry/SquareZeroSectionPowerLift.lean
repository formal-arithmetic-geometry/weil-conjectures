/-- Some positive tensor power of the given section lifts, after the tensor-power
and pullback identifications. The conclusion is equality of section morphisms;
it makes no assertion about nonvanishing loci or affineness upstairs.

Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology of Schemes, Lemma 09MS, equation (30.17.5.1)
and the following boundary calculation.
(blueprint: lem-sc-square-zero-section-power-lift).

Proof:
1. Put N = j^*L and M_d = I tensor L^d. Invertibility makes tensoring the
   closed-immersion ideal sequence exact. The unit-quotient theorem identifies
   its quotient with j_*j^*(L^d). Pullback commutes with tensor products, giving
   j_*(N^d). Both I and M_d are quasi-coherent, and I M_d = 0 by I^2 = 0.
2. The annihilated-module theorem identifies M_d with j_*G_d, G_d = j^*M_d.
   The affine-morphism edge isomorphism identifies H^1(X,M_d) with H^1(Z,G_d).
   The degree-n exact sequence gives a connecting class xi for s.
3. Take the direct sums over all d of these exact sequences, with the tensor
   multiplication on powers of L. Locally a frame makes the algebra a polynomial
   algebra, hence commutative. Its kernel has square zero because I^2 = 0.
   The boundary derivation theorem gives partial(s^k) = k s^(k-1) xi by induction.
   Naturality for inclusion and projection of each graded summand identifies
   this boundary with the boundary of the degree-nk exact sequence.
4. Local Noetherianity implies quasi-separatedness. The affine-open cohomology
   killing theorem on Z, applied to N^n, s, G_n, and xi, gives e with s^e xi = 0.
   Naturality of the edge isomorphism for multiplication by s^e transports this
   equality to X. Thus partial(s^(e+1)) = 0; exactness supplies t in L^(n*(e+1)).
5. Set k = e+1. Iterate the pullback tensor comparison and the associators to
   identify j^*(L^(n*k)) with (N^n)^k. For n = 0 use the monoidal unit comparison;
   for positive n use the tensor comparisons inductively. Choose this isomorphism
   as e in the conclusion. These comparisons send the restriction of t to s^k,
   so the corresponding morphisms from the structure module are equal as stated.
   No fibre or nonvanishing calculation is needed here. -/
