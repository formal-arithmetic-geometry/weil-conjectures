/-- An injective sheaf of constant-coefficient modules has an injective ringed-site
module realization with the same underlying abelian presheaf.

Source: Stacks Project, Modules on Sites, Sections 093I and 03CV; Sites Example 0H7J;
Cohomology on Sites, Tags 03FC and 03FD. This is the constant-coefficient interface
in step 1 of lem-weil-pbc-injective-etale-module-cech-h1.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-injective-etale-constant-ring-module)

Proof: Sheafify the constant presheaf of rings with value Λ to obtain R.
The underlying-set identification uses lem-weil-pbc-ring-sheafification-underlying-sets;
local representatives and local equality use lem-weil-pbc-site-sheafification-sections-local
(Stacks Sites 00YR and 00WK).
Every section of R is locally the image of a constant scalar. Given such a local representative a
and a section x of J, define a*x using the Λ-action after restriction. The local
sections agree on overlaps: equality of representatives in the sheafification is
local equality, and the restrictions of J are Λ-linear. The sheaf axiom glues these
sections uniquely. Refining representatives proves independence of the choice, the
module laws and compatibility with restriction. This makes J a sheaf M of R-modules
without changing its abelian presheaf. Conversely restrict any R-module along the
constant scalar map Λ → R. The same local description and uniqueness of gluing show
these operations are inverse on objects and on morphisms. Thus they give an equivalence
between Λ-module sheaves and R-module sheaves. Equivalences preserve monomorphisms
and transport extensions across monomorphisms, so injectivity of J implies injectivity
of M. The identity on local sections supplies the displayed presheaf isomorphism.
The argument also applies to Λ = 0 and the empty scheme: all relevant sections and
module laws are then forced, and no nonempty covering or nonzero scalar is assumed. -/
