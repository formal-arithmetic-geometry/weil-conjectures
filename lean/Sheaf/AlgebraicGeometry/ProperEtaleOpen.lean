/-- An open containing the closed fiber of a scheme proper over an adically complete
base is the whole scheme.

Proof: Put h = g ≫ f and let C be the closed complement of W. Properness makes
h(C) closed; write it as V(K). If x belongs to C, K is contained in the prime h(x),
which is contained in a maximal ideal m. Thus m belongs to V(K), so h(t) = m for
some t in C. Completeness gives I ≤ jacobson(0), hence I ≤ m. The quotient spectrum
has image V(I), and the range of the base-changed projection Y ×_A Spec(A/I) → Y
is f⁻¹(V(I)). Therefore g(t) is in that range, and the hypothesis puts t in W,
contradicting t in C. The complement is empty, so W = ⊤. This includes empty X. -/
