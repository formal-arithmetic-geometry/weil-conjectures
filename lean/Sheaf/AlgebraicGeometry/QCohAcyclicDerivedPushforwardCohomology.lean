/-- If higher direct images vanish on quasi-coherent modules, cohomology of unbounded
 derived pushforward is naturally isomorphic to direct image of cohomology.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 08D4, 08D5 and 0AVW
(blueprint: lem-sc-qcoh-acyclic-derived-pushforward-cohomology).

Proof: (1) On every affine open V of Y, qcqs direct image preserves quasi-coherence
(Tags 01XJ and 01XB). Leray and affine vanishing show that sections on f⁻¹V have no
positive derived functors on quasi-coherent modules. Sections commute with countable
products. Apply lem-sc-qcoh-acyclic-derived-sections-comparison, using Tag 08D4 with
N = 1, to identify H^i(RΓ(f⁻¹V,E)) with Γ(f⁻¹V,H^i(E)), naturally in E and in V.
(2) This identifies the derived-section cohomology presheaf on the affine basis with
V ↦ Γ(V,f_*H^i(E)). By the final clause of the same section-comparison node, its
sheafification is H^i(Rf_*E), whereas the latter presheaf is the restriction of the
sheaf f_*H^i(E).
(3) The universal property of sheafification (def-weil-pbc-sheafification) glues these
restriction-compatible identifications to the displayed sheaf isomorphism. The section
comparison and derived direct image are functorial in E, so the isomorphism is natural. -/
