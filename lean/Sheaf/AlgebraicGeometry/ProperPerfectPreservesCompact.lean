/-- Proper perfect pushforward preserves compact quasi-coherent derived objects.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 09M1, 0B6G, and the first paragraph of Tag 0A9R.
(blueprint: lem-sc-proper-perfect-preserves-compact).

Proof: Noetherian schemes are quasi-compact and quasi-separated. Use K-injective
resolutions and the uniqueness of localization to work in small-Hom derived
models on X, Y, and all their opens. These equivalences commute with homology,
derived restriction, and derived direct image, and preserve coproducts and the
additive Hom comparisons defining compactness. Tag 09M1 identifies the given
compact object P with a perfect object in the small model: affine restriction
preserves compactness by its direct-sum-preserving right adjoint, and the affine
compact-object criterion gives local bounded finite-projective representatives.
The stalkwise finite Tor assumption is the perfect-morphism criterion, so apply
proper_perfect_directImage_perfect (Tag 0B6G) to that perfect object.
Its image is perfect on Y and therefore compact by perfectObjectCompact.
Transport back to the original models. The component eR.app P identifies the
ambient image with (R.obj P).obj. Since the inclusion of D_QCoh is fully faithful,
this isomorphism lifts to D_QCoh(Y); isomorphic objects have identical compactness
comparisons under the induced additive Hom equivalences. Thus R.obj P is compact.
No right adjoint of R, generator, or representative family is assumed. -/
