/-- The graded algebra and finite graded module construction, without the independent
quasi-coherence assertion about the coproduct of kernels.
Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology of Schemes, Lemma 087Z (affine proof), via Lemma 087W
and Section 0EHN; https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/087Z.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-formal-systems-kernel-rees-finite-existence).

Proof:
1. The reduction condition iterates to identify F_l / I^r F_l with F_r for l >= r >= 1.
The transitions are sheaf epimorphisms. A local lift of x in K_n to F_(m+n+1) lies in
I^n F_(m+n+1), with I^0 F = F. Multiplication by a in I^m therefore gives an element
of K_(m+n). Differences of lifts lie in I^(n+1) F_(m+n+1), and differences of
representatives of a lie in I^(m+1); their products vanish by annihilation at level
m+n+1. Thus the result glues uniquely. Local representatives of quotient sections
exist because quotient projections are sheaf epimorphisms. This gives bilinear,
restriction-compatible action maps on every open, including nonaffine opens.
2. The same construction multiplies I^m/I^(m+1) and I^n/I^(n+1). Products of power
ideal sections factor through I^(m+n) by iterated ideal multiplication; this supplies
c in the displayed formula. Changing representatives changes the product by
I^(m+n+1). The degree-zero unit is the quotient projection from O_X. Ring and
module laws follow locally by using representatives and lifts to one common level:
both associativity expressions become (ab)t = a(bt), commutativity becomes ab = ba,
and the unit acts as 1. Sheaf uniqueness makes these local equalities global, giving
A and a graded module M with the required formulas for every existing lift t.
3. On an affine neighbourhood Spec R, Lemma 087W identifies the formal system with
N/I^r N for a finite module N over the I-adic completion of R. Ideal-product and
quotient affine sections identify the algebra pieces with I^n/I^(n+1) and the kernel
pieces with I^n N/I^(n+1) N, including K_0 = N/IN. The tilde/global-sections
adjunction identifies their sheaves, and the representative formulas from steps 1--2
identify the operations with multiplication on these module quotients.
4. The completed-module associated-graded generator lemma gives finite generators of
N/IN and says their lifts generate each I^n N/I^(n+1) N with coefficients from I^n.
Tilde preserves the resulting epimorphism from a finite sum of graded algebra copies.
Choose the corresponding degree-zero sections on the affine neighbourhood. For any
section on any smaller open, this sheaf epimorphism supplies coefficient sections
locally near each point; its degree-n component is exactly the finite sum in
IsLocallyGeneratedInDegreeZero. Affine neighbourhoods cover X, proving that predicate.
No global lifts or global generating family on X are asserted. -/
