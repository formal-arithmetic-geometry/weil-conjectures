/-- Restriction of a K-injective module complex to C/U is K-injective, for any
Grothendieck topology on C.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 08FI, Lemma 21.20.1, also used in Tag 0A94
(blueprint: lem-pur-kinjective-restrict-localized).

Proof: extension by zero sends a module presheaf N on C/U to the presheaf whose
sections at V are the direct sum of N(V,f) over arrows f : V to U, with the
R(V)-action on each summand given by restriction of R. Sheafify this presheaf.
The sectionwise adjunction, followed by the sheafification adjunction, makes this
functor left adjoint to restriction. The direct-sum functor and module
sheafification are exact; hence extension by zero is exact. Given an acyclic
complex A on C/U and a chain map A to I|U, the induced adjunction on complexes
transports it to a map from the acyclic extension of A to I. K-injectivity of I
makes that map null-homotopic. The additive adjunction transports the homotopy
back to the original chain map. This is the definition of K-injectivity of I|U.
No pullbacks, small-site hypothesis, or boundedness is required. For I = 0 this
recovers the zero homotopy, and localization at any U uses the same argument. -/
