/-- Naturality after one projection of the target Hom complex.
Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology on Sites, Lemma 21.34.1 (Tag 0A90),
functoriality; its proof refers to More on Algebra, Lemma 15.73.1.
(blueprint: lem-sc-hom-tensor-naturality-component)

Proof: Fix the total source degree `p` and target degree `q = p + n`.
Use extensionality of sheaf morphisms, then of sections of the internal Hom:
a section over `U` is a map on the localized site over `U`. For each such
section of the iterated Hom, compare the resulting maps out of the total
source term on that localized site. The total term is the coproduct of
`K'^i ⊗ L'^j` with `i + j = p`. It suffices to compare on each summand.
By the sheafification adjunction, maps out of that sheaf tensor are determined
on the presheaf tensor; by the tensor universal property they are determined
on pure tensors `x ⊗ y` over every further object of the localized site.

The componentwise functoriality formula in `homComplex_exists` says that
precomposition by `f` sends the outer map to evaluation at `f^i(x)`,
precomposition by `g` sends the inner map to evaluation at `g^j(y)`,
and postcomposition applies `h^q` to the resulting value. Apply the defining
equation `homTensorDegreewiseMap_spec` at `(i,j)` to the left composite:
its value is `h^q(φ_i(f^i(x))_j(g^j(y)))`.
For the right composite the same functoriality formula precomposes with
the degree-`p` total tensor map and postcomposes with `h^q`.
The identity `HomologicalComplex.ι_mapBifunctorMap` restricts that map to
the termwise tensor map on the `(i,j)` summand. Naturality of the
sheafification unit and tensor comparison sends the image of `x ⊗ y` to
the image of `f^i(x) ⊗ g^j(y)`. The same defining currying equation
therefore gives the same value. These formulas commute with all localized
restrictions, since they are presheaf morphisms. Tensor, sheafification,
coproduct, internal-Hom and sheaf-morphism extensionality give the asserted
single-projection equality. No product extensionality for the target Hom term
and no differential calculation enter this component argument. -/
