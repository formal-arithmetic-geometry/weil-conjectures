/-- The localized comparison of universal models is compatible with a complex coproduct.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 06Y6 (K-flat calculation and independence of choices),
and Tag 0DJA(1), the tensor-inheritance calculation.

Proof: Restrict M_j to R. Choose K-flat resolutions P_j and take their termwise
coproduct. Exactness of module coproducts makes the sum augmentation a
quasi-isomorphism. Tensor with an acyclic complex commutes with this coproduct,
so the sum resolution is K-flat. Specialize the fixed-second-factor derived
tensor computation to B in degree zero, identified with ordinary R-to-B
extension by the one-term tensor
isomorphism. Its counit is invertible on each P_j and their K-flat sum.
Ordinary extension commutes with sums, so this computes the derived sum.
Use the derived module direct-sum and homology-coproduct lemmas to see that
its degree-i homology is the coproduct of the summand homologies. Uniqueness
of counit-compatible derived functors compares this calculation with all the
supplied models. The model-map construction lifts the induced B-linear maps
of cohomology to E-linear maps: naturality at multiplication by each a in A
and the cohomologyIso_smul equations give compatibility with a tensor 1,
and B-linearity gives compatibility with 1 tensor b. Tensor induction gives
E-linearity. The inverse of the sum comparison is E-linear by the same action
compatibility, hence these maps form an E-module coproduct. Extension from E
to C preserves that coproduct because it is a left adjoint, producing e.
For each j, naturality of the universal counit and the ordinary tensor
associator gives compatibility with comparison. The prescribed pure-tensor
values of ordinaryIso and ordinaryToLocalized identify their naturality
squares. Apply the extension/restriction adjunction to this equation; its
naturality and localized_eq give the displayed equation. No exactness of
extension to C is required: only its preservation of coproducts is used.
Empty families give zero homology and the unique map between zero objects;
zero rings and zero complexes are included by the same construction.
