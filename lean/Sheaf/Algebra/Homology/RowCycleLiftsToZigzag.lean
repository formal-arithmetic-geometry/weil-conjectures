/-- (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-double-complex-row-cycle-lifts-to-zigzag)
In a first-quadrant homological double complex whose rows are exact in positive
horizontal degrees, every cycle in the cokernel of the first horizontal map
has a representative which extends to a zig-zag. The row-cokernel complex
`Aʳᵗ` is `A.opcycles 0`, formed in the abelian category of chain complexes:
its degree `q` is the cokernel of `d₁,ᵩ : A₁,ᵩ → A₀,ᵩ`, with projection
`π = A.pOpcycles 0` and differential induced by `δ`. The hypothesis `hcycle`
says that `πₙ(x)` is a cycle of `Aʳᵗ` (automatic at `n = 0`, where there is
no outgoing differential). Row exactness is `ShortComplex.Exact` of
`Aₚ₊₁,ᵩ → Aₚ,ᵩ → Aₚ₋₁,ᵩ` for `p ≥ 1`.

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 00M1 (`lemma-no-spectral-sequence`),
proof lines 18464--18481. Proof, following the node's five steps:

1. If `n = 0`, take the tuple with sole entry `x`. The conditions defining
   `zigzagCycles` are empty (def-weil-pbc-double-complex-zigzag-module).
2. For `0 ≤ k ≤ n`, inductively construct entries `aⱼ,ₙ₋ⱼ` for `0 ≤ j ≤ k`,
   starting with `a₀,ₙ = x`, with `d aⱼ,ₙ₋ⱼ = δ aⱼ₋₁,ₙ₋ⱼ₊₁` for `1 ≤ j ≤ k`.
   The initial partial tuple consists just of `x`.
3. For `n > 0`, the cycle condition says that `δ x` belongs to the kernel of
   the projection onto the row cokernel, hence to the image of `d`. Choose
   `a₁,ₙ₋₁` with `d a₁,ₙ₋₁ = δ x` (def-weil-pbc-module-chain-complex-homology).
4. For `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, put `y = δ aₖ₋₁,ₙ₋ₖ₊₁`. Commutation gives
   `d y = δ d aₖ₋₁,ₙ₋ₖ₊₁ = δ δ aₖ₋₂,ₙ₋ₖ₊₂ = 0`. Row exactness at the
   positive horizontal position `k - 1` gives `aₖ,ₙ₋ₖ` with `d aₖ,ₙ₋ₖ = y`
   (def-weil-pbc-exact-sequence), preserving all previously chosen entries.
5. At `k = n`, assemble the finite tuple in `zigzagTotal A n`. Its adjacent
   equations are precisely those defining `zigzagCycles A n`, and its `(0,n)`
   component remains `x` (def-weil-pbc-double-complex-zigzag-module). -/
