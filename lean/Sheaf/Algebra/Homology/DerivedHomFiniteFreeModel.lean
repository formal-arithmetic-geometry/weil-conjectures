/-- A bounded-above finite free model computes derived internal Hom into a bounded-below
complex of module sheaves on a ringed space.
Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology, Tag 0GM8, case (2), and Cohomology on Sites,
Section 08J7 (blueprint: lem-sc-derived-hom-finite-free-model).

Proof:
1. By `lem-sc-bounded-below-injective-resolution`, choose a quasi-isomorphism `G ⟶ I`
   with `I` bounded below, termwise injective and K-injective.
2. Its cone is bounded below and acyclic. Apply
   `lem-sc-bounded-above-finite-free-hom-acyclic` to that cone: the induced morphism
   `homComplex E G ⟶ homComplex E I` is a quasi-isomorphism.
3. By `def-pur-derived-internal-hom`, `homComplex E I` computes derived internal Hom
   from `Q(E)` to `Q(G)`. The localization comparison into `I` is bijective by
   `lem-sc-kinjective-quasi-iso-comparison`. Localize the quasi-isomorphism in step 2
   and use `f : E ⟶ K` to identify `Q(E)` with `Q(K)`. Compose the resulting
   isomorphisms to obtain the stated representation. -/
