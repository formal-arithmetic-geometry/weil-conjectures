/-- The comparison predicate contains every shift of the free rank-one generator.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 0DJA(1) and 0BYJ.

Proof: for U=A[0], the unitors identify U tensor Q with Q, and the scalar-extension
unit identifies F(U) with C[0]. Naturality of the universal derived counit and
localized_eq identify the comparison with the given comparison for Q. For A[n]
the shift-tensor isomorphisms reindex the comparison by n, so the hypothesis in
every degree proves the assertion. ULift A is canonically A-linearly isomorphic
to A. Finally, a K-flat representative U of the shifted generator computes the
same derived tensor as that generator: represent the derived isomorphism by a
roof and resolve its apex by an A-K-flat complex. K-flat scalar extension and
tensoring with the A-K-flat Q preserve both roof legs. Universality of the
R-to-B derived counit identifies the base-derived cohomology models, including
their A tensor B actions; tensoring their homology isomorphisms with C and using
the natural localized comparison squares proves the condition for every mU.
Thus the predicate's universal quantification over representatives holds. The
argument allows arbitrary shifts, unbounded Q and N, and zero rings.
