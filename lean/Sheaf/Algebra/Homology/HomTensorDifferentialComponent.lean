/-- The component of the iterated Hom differential after degreewise currying.
Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology on Sites, Lemma 21.34.1 (Tag 0A90),
compatibility with differentials
(blueprint: lem-sc-hom-tensor-iterated-differential-component).

Proof: Fix the total source degree t. Expand the outer Hom differential and
then the inner Hom differential using the projection formula in
`homComplex_exists`. On the summand K^p tensor L^q with p+q=t, the currying
condition identifies the resulting localized maps with
 d_M(f(x)(y)) - (-1)^(p+n) f(x)(d_L y) - (-1)^n f(d_K x)(y).
The total tensor differential sends x tensor y to
 d_K x tensor y + (-1)^p x tensor d_L y.
Using (-1)^(p+n)=(-1)^n*(-1)^p, these are precisely the postcomposition
term and the signed precomposition term displayed below. Extend the equality
from pure tensors by bilinearity, then by the sheafification adjunction on
each summand and the coproduct universal property in total degree t.
Finally check sections on every localized site to get equality in the
internal Hom factor. This computes only the iterated-Hom side at one product
factor; the target Hom differential and joint monicity are handled separately.
Zero complexes or zero differentials give zero on both sides; negative integer
degrees use the same negOnePow addition identity. -/
