/-- The explicitly constructed stage inclusions split degreewise, and their
cokernels are coproducts of single-degree copies of the ring.

(blueprint: lem-pc-derived-total-filtration-quotients)

Proof. The coproduct description of the total terms identifies the even stage
`2*j` with the direct sum of the complete columns `-i` for `i<j`. The odd stage
`2*j+1` adds the image of the first arrow in `S j`, transported through `e j`.
The next even stage adds the complete column `-j`. These decompositions are
valid also for `j=0`, when the preceding sum is zero. Projection onto preceding
columns gives a retraction for the even-to-odd map; for the odd-to-even map use
in addition the degreewise retraction in the chosen splitting of `S j`.

The quotient for an even-to-odd map is the first object of `S j`, reindexed from
vertical degree `d` to total degree `d-j`. The quotient for the odd-to-even map
is its third object, reindexed in the same way. Short exactness identifies these
with the categorical cokernels. The horizontal part of the differential lands
in preceding columns and is consequently zero in either quotient. The vertical
part is zero on the two endpoint complexes, since the specified coproducts of
single-degree complexes have zero differential. Multiplication by the total
sign therefore has no effect. Reindex each single summand to degree `d-j` to
obtain the asserted isomorphisms of complexes. Every natural stage is either
`2*j` or `2*j+1`, so these two cases prove the statement for all stages.
