/-- Transport the tensor-algebra cohomology and its localized counit comparison.

Proof: restriction of scalars preserves homology, so the restricted quasi-isomorphism
is invertible in D(R). The universal left-derived property identifies the derived
functors of the two models by a unique natural isomorphism compatible with their
counits. Apply cohomology to the restricted map and this isomorphism, and conjugate
by the two cohomologyIso maps. This is a B-linear isomorphism. Naturality for the
endomorphism a times the identity, together with cohomologyIso_smul, says that it
commutes with multiplication by a tensor 1. B-linearity says the same for 1 tensor b.
Tensor induction then makes it A-tensor-R-B-linear; its inverse is linear too.
Call the resulting isomorphism e. Naturality of the universal counits and the
homology comparison isomorphisms gives the ordinary comparison square using
comparison_eq. The ordinaryIso generator equations identify their conjugated
termwise maps: both send b tensor q to (1 tensor b) tensor s(q).
The ordinaryToLocalized generator equations similarly give a commuting chain-map
square: both routes send t tensor q to the image of t tensor s(q). Apply homology
and compose with the ordinary comparison square. Finally transpose along the
extension/restriction adjunction. Naturality of its unit and localized_eq identify
the two transposes, hence give the asserted localized square. This does not claim
that ordinary extension of the quasi-isomorphism is invertible.
