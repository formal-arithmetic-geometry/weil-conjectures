/-- The unit of the chosen extension-by-zero/restriction adjunction is an isomorphism.

Proof: First use the canonical adjunction obtained by direct-sum injections followed by
module sheafification. On opens contained in W the extension presheaf has one summand,
canonically the original section module. These identifications commute with restriction.
Sheafification on W therefore gives back the original sheaf, and the canonical unit is
an isomorphism. Compare this adjunction with the chosen one by uniqueness of left adjoints:
the comparison is a natural automorphism of extension by zero, and the units differ by
its restriction. Thus the chosen unit is also an isomorphism. The argument works for
W empty (the category of module sheaves is then trivial) and W equal to X. -/
