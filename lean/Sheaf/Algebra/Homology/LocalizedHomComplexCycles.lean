Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0A8X (Hom complexes), leading to Equation 0A8Y
(blueprint: lem-pur-localized-hom-complex-cycles-aux).

Proof: apply section evaluation at U to the product cone specified by
`homComplex_exists`. The forgetful functor from sheaves of modules and evaluation
of presheaves preserve products, as does the forgetful functor from modules to
abelian groups. Sections of the internal Hom at U are natural linear maps of
restricted modules on C/U. Thus a section of degree n is a family of maps
L^p|U to I^(p+n)|U, with components given by the chosen projections. For n = 0,
the differential formula is d_I f - f d_L. Its vanishing says precisely that the
family is a chain map (the non-successive chain-map equations are zero by the
complex shape). The cycle inclusion identifies cycles with the kernel of this
differential. Send a cycle to the resulting chain map. Conversely, assemble the
components of a chain map using the sectionwise product universal property; its
chain-map equations put it in that kernel, hence yield a unique cycle. These
constructions are inverse because the product projections are jointly injective
and the cycle inclusion is injective. The definition of the forward construction
gives the displayed component formula. All products are indexed by integers;
no finite-support or boundedness condition enters. -/
