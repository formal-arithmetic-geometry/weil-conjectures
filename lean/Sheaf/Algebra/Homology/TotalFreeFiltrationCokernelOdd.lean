Proof. In total degree k, remove the full columns with index less than j.
The remaining inclusion is the image of the first arrow into the full column -j.
Short exactness identifies its cokernel with (S j).X₃ in vertical degree k+j.
The horizontal differential goes to a preceding full column, so vanishes in
the quotient. The vertical differential vanishes on the endpoint, since its
given coproduct decomposition has zero differential. Thus the degreewise
identifications commute with differentials and define a complex isomorphism.
Compose the endpoint decomposition with reindexing: a summand supported in
vertical degree d is supported in total degree d-j. The induced quotient map
has the cokernel universal property degreewise, hence in cochain complexes.
The argument also covers j=0, empty bases, and the zero ring. -/
