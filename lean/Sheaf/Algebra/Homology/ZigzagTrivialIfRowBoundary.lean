/-- A zig-zag whose row-cokernel component is a vertical boundary is trivial when
all rows are exact in positive degrees. The row-cokernel complex `Aʳᵗ` is
`A.opcycles 0`, formed in the abelian category of chain complexes: its degree `q` is
the cokernel of `d₁,ᵩ : A₁,ᵩ → A₀,ᵩ`, with projection `π = A.pOpcycles 0` and
differential induced by `δ`. The hypothesis `hboundary` says that `πₙ(a₀,ₙ)` lies in
the image of `δʳᵗ : Aʳᵗₙ₊₁ → Aʳᵗₙ`. Row exactness is `ShortComplex.Exact` of
`Aₚ₊₁,ᵩ → Aₚ,ᵩ → Aₚ₋₁,ᵩ` for `p ≥ 1`.

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, Lemma Tag 00M1, injectivity argument
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-double-complex-zigzag-trivial-if-row-boundary).

First lift a boundary preimage `y` through the cokernel projection in degree `n+1`
to `c` in `A₀,ₙ₊₁`. Since `π` is a chain map, the difference `a₀,ₙ - δ c` has zero
image under `πₙ`. The cokernel property puts it in the image of `d : A₁,ₙ → A₀,ₙ`;
choose a preimage `e`. The total-degree `n+1` tuple supported at `(0,n+1)` and `(1,n)`
with values `c` and `e` has boundary with zeroth component `a₀,ₙ`. Subtract it. The
replacement remains a zig-zag by `lem-weil-pbc-double-complex-zigzag-module-functorial`,
using the definitions in `def-weil-pbc-double-complex-zigzag-module` and the cokernel
chain complex of `def-weil-pbc-module-chain-complex-homology`.

Inductively suppose the components with horizontal index less than `k` vanish,
where `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. The zig-zag equation gives `d aₖ,ₙ₋ₖ = 0`. Exactness of the row at
this positive index (`def-weil-pbc-exact-sequence`) supplies `f` in `Aₖ₊₁,ₙ₋ₖ` with
`d f = aₖ,ₙ₋ₖ`. Subtract the boundary supported there. It kills this component,
changes only the next component, and preserves the zig-zag property by the same
functoriality node. After `k = 1,...,n` every component is zero. All subtracted tuples
belong to the submodule of trivial zig-zags, hence so does the original `a`.
For `n = 0` the first subtraction already finishes. -/
