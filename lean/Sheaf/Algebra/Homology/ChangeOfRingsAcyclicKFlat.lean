/-- Extension of scalars sends an acyclic K-flat complex to an acyclic complex.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 06YT, proof, and Tag 06YY, change-of-rings specialization.

Proof: regard O' as an O-module concentrated in degree zero, called S. Take a K-flat
resolution r : R → S (Tag 06YS). The cone of r is acyclic. By K-flatness of K,
Tot(Cone(r) ⊗ K) is acyclic. The tensor-cone comparison identifies this with the cone
of Tot(r ⊗ id_K), so the latter is a quasi-isomorphism. Since R is K-flat and K is
acyclic, Tot(K ⊗ R) is acyclic. The signed tensor symmetry, acting on the (p,q)
summand by (-1)^(pq) times the module braiding, identifies it with Tot(R ⊗ K).
Thus Tot(S ⊗ K) is acyclic, by invariance of cohomology under quasi-isomorphisms.
There is just one nonzero S-degree, so this last total complex is naturally the
restriction of the termwise extension of scalars of K. Restriction of scalars does
not change the underlying sheaf of abelian groups and is exact and faithful; it
therefore reflects acyclicity. Finally the equalities h and hm give the natural
isomorphism from E to extension of scalars (naturality is exactly hm), and its
termwise complex isomorphism transports acyclicity. No flatness of O' is required.
The zero complex and the zero ring also satisfy the argument: all their relevant
cohomology sheaves vanish.
