Proof: let `L` be an acyclic complex of `B`-modules. Restriction of scalars along `ρ`
is exact: kernels and images have the same underlying additive groups. Thus the
restricted `L` is acyclic over `A`. On pure tensors the maps
`l ⊗ (b ⊗ k) ↦ (b • l) ⊗ k` and `l ⊗ k ↦ l ⊗ (1 ⊗ k)` give inverse
isomorphisms between tensoring `L` over `B` with the extended `K` and tensoring
restricted `L` over `A` with `K`. They commute with each differential. Applying them
to every summand of total degree `n` gives inverse chain maps, including the sign
on the second differential. K-flatness of `K` makes the latter total complex
acyclic. The isomorphism and exactness of restriction of scalars give acyclicity
of the former total complex. This also covers zero rings and unbounded complexes:
there is no flatness hypothesis and each total degree uses a direct sum. -/
