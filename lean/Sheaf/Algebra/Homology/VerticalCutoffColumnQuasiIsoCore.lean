/-- The strict endpoint case of the nested-cutoff comparison.

truncations (https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0118); the nested-cutoff kernel
argument is an agent-written specialization.
(blueprint: lem-sp-vertical-cutoff-column-quasiiso-strict)

Proof: put E = L extended by zero to the integers. Monicity of the cutoff inclusions
identifies g with the natural inclusion of the cutoff below a into the cutoff below b.
Cokernels are degreewise. If b <= 0, the restricted cutoffs and the window are zero.
If a < 0 < b, the lower cutoff is zero and the lower projection is an isomorphism
on E, so the specified map q is an isomorphism. If a = 0 < b, the same conclusion
holds since E is strictly supported in nonnegative degrees. It remains that 0 < a < b.
The source of q is zero below a-1, is the image I of E.d (a-1) a at a-1, and agrees
with the upper cutoff at all degrees at least a. The projection equation makes q
zero at a-1, the quotient by I at a, and an isomorphism above a. For b = a+1 its
component at a is the map from cycles to homology; otherwise it is the map from E.X a
to opcycles. Both are epic with kernel I. Thus q is degreewise epic, with kernel
having I only in degrees a-1 and a, and differential the canonical identity under
these image identifications. This kernel is contractible, using the inverse of that
differential as its sole nonzero contracting-homotopy component. The homology exact
sequence of the kernel-source-window short exact sequence proves q is a
quasi-isomorphism. The restriction to naturals retains both nonzero kernel degrees
in the remaining case 0 < a, completing the proof. -/
