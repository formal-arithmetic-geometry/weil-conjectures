/-- Total cohomology of the vertical smart layer `[q,q+1)` is iterated cohomology.
Source: blueprint thm-sp-double-complex-spectral-sequences, proof step 2;
Stacks, Homology, lemma-ss-double-complex, item (5).
(blueprint: lem-sp-double-complex-vertical-window-homology).

Proof: after extension by zero, smart truncation at q from below replaces the
q-th column term by its opcycles. Smart truncation at q from above then replaces
that term by the kernel of its outgoing differential. This is canonically the
q-th vertical homology. All other vertical terms are zero. These identifications
are natural in the columns, so the remaining horizontal differential is exactly
the one obtained by applying the q-th homology functor. On the total diagonal
of degree p+q there is only this term, indexed (p,q). The vertical differential
is zero and the horizontal term has sign +1. Thus the three-term complex
computing total homology in degree p+q identifies with the three-term complex
computing horizontal homology in degree p. At p=0 both predecessor terms vanish;
at q=0 extension by zero gives the same kernel and cokernel formulas. The
induced short-complex isomorphism gives the asserted homology isomorphism. -/
