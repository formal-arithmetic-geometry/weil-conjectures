/-- Hom from the unit concentrated in degree zero is naturally the identity on complexes.

Source: Stacks Project, sites-cohomology.tex, Sections 0A8X and 08J7.
(blueprint: lem-sc-hom-complex-unit-iso).

Proof:
1. In degree n, the product defining Hom has factors Hom(L^p, M^(p+n)). For
   L = O[0], L^p is zero when p is nonzero, so these factors are zero. The
   projection to p = 0 therefore identifies the product with Hom(O, M^n).
2. Compose this projection with SheafOfModules.homObjUnitIso, evaluation at one.
   Its inverse sends x to the family whose zero component is r -> r*x and
   whose other components are zero. The product universal property and the
   two inverse identities for evaluation prove both inverse identities.
3. The differential formula in homComplex_exists has a zero precomposition
   term because L has zero differential. Its remaining term is postcomposition
   by the differential of M, which commutes with evaluation at one. Thus the
   degreewise isomorphisms form a chain isomorphism.
4. The map formula in homComplex_exists identifies the action of a chain map
   with postcomposition in every degree. Evaluation commutes with this action,
   giving the asserted natural isomorphism. This applies in every integer
   degree, without any boundedness or injectivity hypothesis. -/
