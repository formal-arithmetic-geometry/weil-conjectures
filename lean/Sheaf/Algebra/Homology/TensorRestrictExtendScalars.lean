/-- Restricting a tensor total complex after extension of the second factor agrees
with tensoring its restriction with the original second factor.
Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Tag 06Y1, proof.
(blueprint: lem-pc-tensor-restrict-extend-scalars)

Proof: in bidegree (p,q), define the A-linear map on balanced pure tensors by
`l ⊗ (b ⊗ k) ↦ (b • l) ⊗ k`. The inverse is `l ⊗ k ↦ l ⊗ (1 ⊗ k)`.
The A-balancing relations follow from the restricted action through the ring homomorphism;
the B-balancing relation follows from associativity of the B-action on L. Tensor induction
shows both composites are identities. These maps are natural in both module factors:
B-linearity of each differential of L handles the first factor, and A-linearity of the
differentials of K handles the second. Hence they commute with both bicomplex differentials.
Restriction of scalars preserves coproducts. Apply the bidegree maps on every summand
p+q=n and the coproduct universal property to obtain inverse degreewise maps. Their
compatibility with both differentials also implies compatibility with the total differential,
including its sign (-1)^p. Thus they define inverse cochain maps. The construction uses no
flatness or boundedness: coproduct maps have finite support on each input, even for an
unbounded complex, and the same tensor formulas hold for zero rings. -/
