/-- The locally constant integer cochain complex is additive and degreewise exact.

Source: Stacks Project, Etale Cohomology, Tag 0DVG, displayed inhomogeneous
cochain differential; steps 1 and 2 of lem-sc-locally-constant-cochains-effaceable.

Proof: Give LC(G^n,E(M)) its pointwise additive group structure. Precomposition by
projections and adjacent multiplication preserves local constancy. For the action face,
a locally constant cochain has finitely many values since G^n is compact. Intersect the
open stabilizers of these values: on each fiber and a sufficiently small coset the action
face is constant. Thus the displayed sum is a locally constant additive differential.
The face identities pair each summand in d squared with its negative, so d squared is
zero, including n=0. Equivariant coefficient maps commute with the action and the other
faces, hence give chain maps; identity, composition and addition hold pointwise.
Use these actual terms and differentials to construct C and take identity coordinate
maps, transporting along E. Equivalences preserve short exact sequences. Kernels and
cokernels of discrete representations are the underlying module kernels and cokernels:
submodules inherit open stabilizers and quotient stabilizers contain those of lifts.
A locally constant cochain on compact G^n has finite image and clopen fibers. Choose a
lift of each image value through a coefficient surjection and use it on that fiber.
This is a locally constant lift. The kernel equation is pointwise, proving exactness
and monicity of the first map in every degree. No finiteness of the ring is used.
