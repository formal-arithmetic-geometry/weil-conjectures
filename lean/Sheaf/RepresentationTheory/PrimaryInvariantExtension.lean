/-- A proper stable subgroup of a finite primary module can be enlarged by a
nonzero trivial quotient killed by the prime.

Proof: Form the nonzero finite quotient A = V / W with its induced Q-action.
It remains ℓ-primary. A nonzero element has order divisible by ℓ, so ℓ divides
its cardinality. The fixed-point counting theorem for p-group actions, with
zero as one fixed point, supplies a second fixed point. Hence the invariant
subgroup I is nonzero and ℓ-primary. Its cardinality is divisible by ℓ, and
Cauchy's theorem gives an element y of order ℓ in I. Let L consist of all
invariants in A killed by ℓ; it contains y, so is nonzero. The inverse image W'
of L strictly contains W. Every element of L is fixed, so W' is stable and
ρ g x - x lies in W for x in W'. The condition ℓ L = 0 likewise gives ℓ x ∈ W.
This is an agent-written elementary proof of the finite-module case underlying
the filtration assertion of Tag 0GIZ, using Mathlib's fixed-point count and
Cauchy's theorem, instead of the augmentation-ideal hint in that source.
