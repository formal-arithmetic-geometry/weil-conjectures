/-- The functor `H^q(G, -)` on discrete left `A`-modules with continuous `G`-action.
Its value on `M` is the `q`-th right derived functor of invariants, computed using
injective resolutions in the ordinary abelian category `DiscreteContinuousRep A G`.
The category uses open stabilizers and equivariant `A`-linear maps; its abelian structure
and enough injectives come from `discreteModules_abelian`.

The invariant functor is chosen from `continuousCochains_derived_invariants`: its objects
are naturally linearly equivalent to the submodules `⨅ g, ker (ρ g - id)`, precisely
`{m | ∀ g, ρ g m = m}`, and its maps are the restrictions of the coefficient maps.
That same theorem identifies these derived functors naturally with cohomology of the
continuous inhomogeneous cochain complex, with the usual differential and discrete
coefficient topology. Choosing data from that theorem postpones the existence and comparison
proofs, not the definition's data. No finiteness condition is imposed on the modules.
