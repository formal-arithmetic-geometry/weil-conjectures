/-- Every bounded finite-dimensional field complex is the rational fibre of an
integral constructible complex.
Source: blueprint finite-coefficient-point, the rational essential-surjectivity
argument in step 10; vector-space basis and cohomology decomposition.
(blueprint: lem-weil-point-rational-sections-lattice).

Proof: choose finite bases of the finitely many nonzero cohomology spaces of V.
Lift their vectors to cycles in a representative complex. This gives a
quasi-isomorphism from the bounded zero-differential complex with E^d_i in degree i
to that representative. The identical ranks define a bounded finite free O_E
complex P. Since O_E is complete, P is derived complete. It therefore belongs to
pointFgComplete; use the inverse of the integral equivalence to obtain K with
integral section complex isomorphic to P. The integral-to-field tensor carries
P to the displayed E-complex. The canonical size-descent counit identifies that
scalar extension with pointIntegralRationalFibre(K), giving the required isomorphism.
For V = 0 use the empty complex. This constructs objects only and makes no claim
about rational Hom groups. -/
