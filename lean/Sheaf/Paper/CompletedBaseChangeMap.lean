/-- The ordered construction, extended to ambient inputs. Its first arrow is Rlim(h),
with completed pullback definitionally Rlim(A); its middle arrow is Rlim(v'); its last
arrow is the inverse of the specified direct-image/Rlim conjugate. No arbitrary
isomorphism between the resulting objects is substituted for a comparison.

/-- The completed base-change map on the precise domain of the blueprint: proper f,
derived-complete K, and a retained bounded-below etale-origin witness at every finite
quotient. The formula itself is the ambient ordered composite above; the witnesses
certify its finite exchange maps and impose no compatibility or uniform bound.
