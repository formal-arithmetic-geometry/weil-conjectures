# Restricted pushforward under its preservation hypothesis

Source: the blueprint, `sec-six-functors-basics`, restriction paragraph of
`sk-def-sfb-dc-restricted-functors` (blueprint: sk-def-sfb-dc-restricted-functors).

The imported module supplies all the restricted operations and their structural maps for
its named coefficient classes. Here the same restriction and restricted adjunction are
constructed from preservation itself, allowing arbitrary commutative condensed coefficients.
