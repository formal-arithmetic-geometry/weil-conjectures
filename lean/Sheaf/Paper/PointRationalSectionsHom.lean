/-- The scalar extension of the integral Hom map is an additive isomorphism, with
its prescribed pure-tensor formula.
Source: Stacks, More on Algebra, Tag 0A6A, equation-base-change-RHom;
the point-fibre argument, step 9.
(blueprint: lem-weil-point-rational-sections-hom).

Proof: the integral equivalence identifies the integral Hom modules linearly, by
pointIntegralFibre_linear. Over the coefficient DVR, bounded finite cohomology
complexes are perfect: finite modules have finite free resolutions of length one,
and the perfect-cohomology assembly theorem applies. Apply perfect RHom base
change to O_E → E and these perfect section complexes. The field E is localization
at the uniformizer and is flat. Thus H^0 commutes with this tensor product; H^0 of
RHom is the derived Hom group by the K-injective Hom-complex theorem. The normalized
base-change map sends f tensor a to a times the extended map f. Insert the canonical
localization-field equivalence, commute the tensor factors, and transport along the
specified size-descent counit. All these maps are additive isomorphisms and their
pure-tensor formulas give exactly the equality below, including zero and torsion
Hom modules. No essential-surjectivity assertion is used or proved here. -/
