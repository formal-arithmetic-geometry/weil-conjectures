/-- A family of arrows isomorphic over its target to a covering family is covering
up to a bijective reindexing, and hence is covering after reindexing.

Proof (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-site-covering-isomorphic-family):
1. Base change the covering `g` along `φ` using
   `Precoverage.IsStableUnderBaseChange` and the chosen pullbacks supplied by
   `Precoverage.HasPullbacks`.
2. For each index, the commuting square formed by `σ a` and `φ` is a pullback:
   its universal factorization is obtained by composing with the inverses of
   these isomorphisms.
3. The chosen pullback and `(Vₐ a, σ a, f a)` are therefore uniquely
   isomorphic, with the projection to `V` identified with `f a`.
4. Each comparison isomorphism is a singleton covering by `HasIsos`; composing
   these singleton coverings with the base-changed covering uses
   `IsStableUnderComposition`.
5. The resulting indexing type is a sigma type of singleton indices, hence is
   bijective with `A`; this gives the reindexed covering. Presieves identify
   bijective reindexings, giving the final covering clause.
