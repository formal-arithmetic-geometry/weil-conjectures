/-- If a scheme is a finite disjoint coproduct of open-and-closed pieces each
isomorphic to the base, its étale direct image is the product of the restrictions.
Source: Stacks Project, Lemma 095B, lines 9982--9991
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-direct-image-split-cover-product).

Proof (the five steps of the node):
1. For each étale `W → X`, base change decomposes `W ×_X Y` into the clopen
   pieces over `V j`. The inverse of `V j → X` identifies each piece with `W`;
   the maps `σ j = (id, s j ∘ w)` are their inclusions and form an étale cover.
   Use def-pc-fibre-product, lem-weil-pbc-open-fibre-product, and
   lem-weil-pbc-etale-composition-cancellation.
2. Apply the sheaf equalizer condition to this cover. Distinct pieces have empty
   overlap and the empty covering gives `H(∅) = 0`; the two projections on a
   self-overlap agree. Every family of sections is compatible, so the restriction
   map to the product is bijective and additive, including the empty product.
3. The restrictions are sheaves by lem-weil-pbc-etale-inverse-image-restriction.
   Their sectionwise product is a sheaf by
   lem-weil-pbc-site-sheaf-sets-limits-sectionwise. The identity
   `h_Y ∘ σ_{j,W'} = σ_{j,W} ∘ h` gives naturality of the restriction maps.
4. Both coefficient maps `Λ_X → Λ_Y|_{s j}` send a constant `λ` to the same
   section, hence agree by def-weil-pbc-sheafification. Semilinearity of the
   restrictions then gives `Λ_X`-linearity (def-weil-sheaf-of-modules-category;
   Stacks sites-modules, 03D6 and 03DH).
5. The componentwise inverse is linear and natural, giving the asserted
   isomorphism with the specified components. The sectionwise product has the
   module-sheaf product universal property; for empty `J` it is the zero sheaf.

`localizationRestriction` is the source's literal restriction along composition,
so the equality below specifies the maps of the node, not merely an arbitrary
isomorphism between the two objects. -/
