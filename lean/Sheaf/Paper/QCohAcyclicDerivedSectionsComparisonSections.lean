/-- On the full category of affine opens of Y, derived section cohomology of an
object with quasi-coherent cohomology agrees with sections of its cohomology sheaf.

Source: Stacks Project, Tags 08D4 and 08D5
(blueprint: new-qcoh-acyclic-sections-component).

Proof:
1. Fix an affine open V and put U = f⁻¹V. Restriction of an injective resolution
   to U computes cohomology there (`lem-sc-ringed-space-restrict-injective-resolution`).
   Open restriction commutes with derived direct image
   (`lem-pc-restrict-derived-direct-image-open`), so the positive higher direct images
   of F|U vanish by hacyc. They are quasi-coherent by the quasi-coherence clause
   of `lem-pc-finite-support-hi` (only this clause is used). Affine vanishing
   (`lem-pc-affine-vanishing`) and the Leray edge
   (`lem-pc-leray-degenerate-sections`) give H^p(U,F|U) = 0 for every p > 0.
   Sections on U commute with countable products, by their universal property.
2. Shift the derived object to reduce to degree zero. Apply
   `lem-pc-unbounded-derived-functor-cohomological-bound` with N = 1 to τ≤(-1)E.
   Its derived sections vanish in degrees zero and one. The truncation triangle
   therefore identifies H^0(RΓ(U,E)) with H^0(RΓ(U,τ≥0 E)).
3. Apply `thm-sp-truncation-e2` to a bounded-below representative of τ≥0 E.
   Its E₂ page is R^pΓ(U,H^q(E)); step 1 kills all p > 0, while negative p
   and q vanish by the quadrant bounds. The finite filtration in total degree
   zero has just its p = q = 0 piece, giving Γ(U,H^0(E)). Undo the shift.
4. All comparisons come from the resolution, truncation maps and the natural
   spectral-sequence edge. They commute with morphisms of derived objects and
   restriction of affine opens. They are O_Y(V)-linear because these constructions
   commute with scalar multiplication. Hence the component isomorphisms assemble
   into the displayed natural isomorphism of module presheaves. -/
