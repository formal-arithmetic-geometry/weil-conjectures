/-- The common-stage fibre commutes with shifts and has distinguished image on
each distinguished finite-stage triangle.
Source: blueprint finite-coefficient-point, final display, steps 13–14;
pointCompletedScalarShift and pointSectionsTensorShift.
(blueprint: lem-weil-point-qbar-fibre-shift-descent).

Proof: use the exact rational sections comparison supplied by localization at
each coefficient field, and then the termwise field tensor comparison. The
completed scalar comparison and the sections-tensor comparison commute with
every integer shift by their recorded theorems. Their composite and inverse do
as well, hence so does pointStageFibreScalarIso, including the rationalization
and carrier-lift normalizations. Conjugate these comparisons by the source and
target isoToStage maps. Naturality, the identity comparison, and the three-field
comparison equation make the result independent of the chosen representative
and give the zero and addition shift laws for pointQbarFibre. For a triangle
at stage E, its rational fibre triangle is distinguished by pointRationalFibre_exact.
The coefficient ring equivalence from Shrink E to E and extension from E to the
algebraic closure are exact. Their tensor tower comparisons, and the just-proved
shift compatibility, identify this extended triangle with the realized image
under pointQbarFibre of the stage inclusion. Its three vertices are bounded
finite-dimensional by the definition of pointStageFibre. These data witness
pointFdQbarDistinguished. This proves the assertion only on stage images;
descent along an arbitrary source triangle isomorphism is a separate final step. -/
