/-- Point sections commute naturally with derived reduction in the quotient-module
category. After forgetting quotient scalars the left side is the multiplication cone,
and its cohomology is sections of the reduced cohomology sheaf in every integer degree.

Proof (the ten steps of the node):
1. O_E is a DVR, hence Noetherian. The two-term free resolution
   [O_E --uniformizer^(n+1)--> O_E] resolves the quotient. Completed constant-sheaf
   reduction identifies its completed sheaf version with the finite coefficient sheaf.
2. Resolve the integral sheaf object by a K-flat complex P with flat terms. Tensoring
   the coefficient short exact sequence identifies its derived reduction with P/tP,
   using the balanced map x tensor b-bar to bx modulo t, where t = uniformizer^(n+1).
3. Exact point sections give C = Gamma(P) and identify C/tC with Gamma(P/tP).
   Multiplication by t is injective termwise on C.
4. Resolve C over O_E by a flat-term K-flat complex Q. Multiplication by t is also
   injective termwise on Q, and Q/tQ maps to C/tC as a quotient-linear chain map.
5. The cone T of Q to C is acyclic; its terms have injective multiplication by t,
   and T/tT is the cone of Q/tQ to C/tC, with the identical signed differential.
6. A cycle z-bar of T/tT lifts to z with dz = tw. Injectivity of t implies dw = 0.
   Write w = dv by acyclicity; then z-tv is a cycle and hence a boundary. Reducing
   modulo t proves that z-bar is a boundary. Thus T/tT is acyclic, without bounds.
7. The quotient map Q/tQ to C/tC is a quasi-isomorphism over the quotient ring.
   Compose it with C/tC = Gamma(P/tP) to obtain the asserted derived isomorphism.
8. Simultaneous K-flat replacements of finite arrow and cospan diagrams identify
   all resolution choices and prove naturality. Localization arrows are composites
   of chain maps and inverses of quasi-isomorphisms, so the squares descend.
9. Tensor the two-term free quotient resolution with Q and compare with C.
   K-flat tensor invariance identifies the restricted left side with Cone(t on C),
   whose differential on C^j plus C^(j+1) is (x,y) to (dx+ty,-dy).
10. Take homology of the natural comparison. Exact finite point sections commute
    with homology, giving the final natural isomorphism in every integer degree.
