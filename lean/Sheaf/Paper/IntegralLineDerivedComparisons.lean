/-- Derived quotient extension of a signed line twist is normalized by balancing,
commutes with the strict transitions, and preserves every uniform support interval.
Source: Stacks 06YY, 07A4; blueprint proof (3).
(blueprint: lem-pur-integral-line-derived-comparisons).

Proof: every signed power is a line, so its single complex is K-flat and its tensor
is exact. Apply the normalized ringed-topos derived tensor pullback comparison to
the quotient ring map and compose with b. On good representatives its chain map is
balancing followed by b on the line factor. This gives ChainFormula. Quotient
reduction on both factors gives the transition map, with TransitionFormula; the
square follows on generating tensors, since both routes apply the same quotient
ring homomorphism to every scalar. Descent through the K-flat localization gives
the natural isomorphism d and its representative equation. Cohomology of exact
line tensor is cohomology tensored with the finite line. It takes a zero sheaf to
zero, so after the derived comparison every cohomology degree outside the original
interval still vanishes, with precisely the same endpoints. -/
