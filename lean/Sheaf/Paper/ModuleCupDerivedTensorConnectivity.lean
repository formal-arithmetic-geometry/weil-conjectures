/-- The tensor of degree-zero objects has no positive cohomology.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 06YH, derived tensor using flat resolutions.
(blueprint: lem-sc-module-cup-derived-tensor-connectivity)
Proof: degree-zero objects are in D≤0. The upstream flat-resolution tensor
connectivity theorem gives D≤(0+0), which is D≤0. The result applies to module
sheaves by their recorded closed monoidal Grothendieck structure and functorial
flat resolutions; no flatness assumption on the two coefficient sheaves is used. -/
