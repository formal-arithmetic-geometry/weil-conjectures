/-- Exact horizontal homology rows allow every total homology class to be
represented in column zero.
Source: Stacks Project, Homology, Tag 09IZ, proof, second paragraph.
(blueprint: lem-pc-derived-total-resolution-column-zero)

Proof. Put A_i = K.X (-i). Represent a total homology class in degree n by
an element x of the kernel of the total differential. The coproduct of
modules is a direct sum, so x has finite support in the columns. Positive
columns of K are zero. Thus x has components x_i in A_i^(n+i), for
0 ≤ i ≤ r, for some natural number r. If r > 0, the component of d x in
column r says that x_r is a vertical cycle. The component in column r-1
says that its horizontal image is a vertical boundary (with the total
complex sign). Exactness of the horizontal homology row at A_r lifts the
class of x_r to a class in A_(r+1)^(n+r). Choose a vertical cycle y
representing this class. It has total degree n-1 and vertical differential
zero. Subtract its total boundary, adjusting by the horizontal unit sign
if necessary: the component in column r becomes a vertical boundary.
Choose a primitive t in A_r^(n+r-1). Subtract the total boundary of the
appropriately signed t. The column-r component now vanishes, and the
only other component created lies in column r-1. The largest occupied
index decreases, so induction gives a homologous total cycle supported
in column zero. Its column-zero component is a cycle of A_0, since its
vertical differential is zero. The specified components of j identify
its inclusion with j, so this cycle's homology class is a preimage.
The zero class and the case r = 0 require no reduction. No boundedness
of the vertical complexes is used. -/
