Proof in words. On module-valued sheaves take the conjugate of the canonical
restriction identity for the etale/pro-etale site inclusion. Encode internal modules
sectionwise with the same G. The equality hG identifies underlying restrictions, and
full faithfulness of G lifts their identities to module morphisms. The constant ring
isomorphisms are pulled back from the fixed eR at the profinite point; naturality of
constant-sheaf pullback and associativity of pullback from that point identify the
scalar maps for every scheme morphism. Thus the encoding intertwines inverse images.
Apply these exact functors termwise to complexes and localize at quasi-isomorphisms.
Identify the exact internal pullback with its total left derived functor. Restrict the
etale source to D+ and include the target in the full derived category. For a square,
the two restriction composites agree by sq.w. Conjugation preserves this identity,
as do termwise application, localization and restriction to D+. The canonical derived
composition isomorphisms give precisely the displayed equation, including its equality
transport. No direct-image or right-mate assertion is made here. -/
