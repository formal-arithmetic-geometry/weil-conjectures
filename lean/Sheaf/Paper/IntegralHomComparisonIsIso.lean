Proof: The coefficient valuation ring is a DVR, hence Noetherian. Completion
identifies the restricted quotient with Q_n=[B --t^(n+1)--> B] in degrees -1,0,
with its degree-zero unit. This bounded free complex is K-flat. The coefficient
extension/restriction adjunction and tensor-Hom adjunction identify the restricted
finite internal Hom with Hom_B(K,Res_n N), naturally in N, by Yoneda. Resolve K
by K-flat P and L by K-injective I. The bounded split-free tensor lemma makes
Tot(I tensor Q_n) K-injective. The restriction of the displayed comparison is
therefore modeled by Hom(P,I) tensor Q_n to Hom(P,Tot(I tensor Q_n)). On a
homogeneous f tensor q it is x maps to (-1)^(degree(q)*degree(x)) f(x) tensor q.
In each total degree, the two finite coefficient degrees commute with the product
over degrees of P, making this a degreewise isomorphism even when P is unbounded.
The differential terms involving d_I,d_P,d_Q have signs respectively bp,
a+1+bp,a+bp+p on x of degree p, on both sides. Thus it is a chain isomorphism.
The evaluation and scalar-unit normalizations identify it with the restriction
of comparison, rather than just an unspecified isomorphism of its endpoints.
Restriction is conservative: it preserves the underlying cohomology sheaves.
Hence the comparison itself is an isomorphism over the finite quotient. The
argument includes zero inputs and n=0, which denotes the first positive power. -/
