# The selected finite relative affine presentation

Let `{Dⱼ}` be a cofiltered system of schemes with limit cone `c` and let `g : X ⟶ lim Dⱼ` be a
morphism from a quasi-compact scheme. A finite relative affine presentation of `X` over
`lim Dⱼ` (`AlgebraicGeometry.RelativeAffinePresentation`) consists of a stage `D_{i₀}`, finitely
many affine opens `Vₐ ⊆ D_{i₀}` and affine opens `Wₐ ⊆ X` covering `X` with `Wₐ` lying over `Vₐ`.
The preimages of the `Vₐ` in `lim Dⱼ` are affine opens whose rings are the filtered colimits
of the rings of the preimages of `Vₐ` at the later stages, and the charts `Wₐ` are finitely
presented over them when `g` is locally of finite presentation.

The overlaps `Wₐ ∩ W_b`, recorded as opens of `Wₐ`, together with both directions of the
overlap isomorphisms, form gluing data along opens
(`AlgebraicGeometry.RelativeAffinePresentation.glueData`), which records the finitely many
identity, inverse and cocycle equations.

/-- Selected finite relative affine
presentation `R_X` of `g: X ⟶ lim Dⱼ`.

It consists of a stage `i₀`, a finite index type `J`, affine opens `base a` of `D_{i₀}` (whose
preimages in `lim Dⱼ` have rings that are filtered colimits of stage rings) and affine opens
`chart a` of `X` covering `X`, with `chart a` mapping into `base a`. The overlaps, both
directions of the overlap isomorphisms and their identity, inverse and cocycle equations are
`AlgebraicGeometry.RelativeAffinePresentation.glueData`; the quasi-compactness of the overlaps
is `AlgebraicGeometry.RelativeAffinePresentation.isCompact_overlap`. -/
