# Global functions on a proper scheme over a field

Let `X` be a proper scheme over a field `k`.

- If `X` is integral, then `Γ(X, 𝒪_X)` is a field, finite over `k`
  (`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.isField_globalSections_of_universallyClosed`,
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.finite_globalSectionsRingHom_of_isProper`).
- If `X` is geometrically integral, then `Γ(X, 𝒪_X) = k`
  (`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.GlobalSectionsBijective.of_geometricallyIntegral`).
- If `X` is geometrically reduced, then `Γ(X, 𝒪_X) = k` if and only if `X` is geometrically
  connected (`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.globalSectionsBijective_iff_geometricallyConnected`).

/-- **Global functions on a proper integral scheme.** If `X` is integral and universally closed
(for instance proper) over a field `k`, then `Γ(X, 𝒪_X)` is a field: it is a domain which is
integral over `k` (`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.isIntegral_globalSectionsRingHom`). For proper `X`
it is moreover finite over `k` by finiteness of coherent cohomology
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.finite_globalSectionsRingHom_of_isProper`), so it is a finite field
extension of `k`. Part (2) of the blueprint node is
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.GlobalSectionsBijective.of_geometricallyIntegral`.

/-- **`H⁰(X, 𝒪_X) = k` is equivalent to geometric connectedness.** A proper geometrically
reduced scheme `X` over a field `k` has `Γ(X, 𝒪_X) = k` if and only if it is geometrically
connected. If `Γ(X, 𝒪_X) = k`, then by flat base change `Γ(X_K, 𝒪_{X_K}) = K` for every field
`K` over `k` (`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.GlobalSectionsBijective.pullback`), so `X_K` is connected;
the converse is Stacks 0BUG
