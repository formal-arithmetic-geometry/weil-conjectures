# Geometry of the normal cone of a section

Let `g : V ⟶ B` have a section `s`. The projection `π_N : N_s ⟶ B` of the normal cone
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.normalConeProj`) factors through the affine morphism
`N_s = Spec_V (⨁ I^r / I^{r+1}) ⟶ V` followed by `g`. Hence it is affine, separated or
quasi-compact as soon as `g` is. When `g` is smooth of relative dimension `d` and `s` is a closed
section, `π_N` is smooth of relative dimension `d`, being the fibre over `t = 0` of the smooth
deformation `g̃`. It is then compactifiable over a quasi-compact quasi-separated base, by Nagata's
theorem. These are the hypotheses under which the section invariant `𝒞(π_N, 0_N)` of the
normal bundle is defined.
