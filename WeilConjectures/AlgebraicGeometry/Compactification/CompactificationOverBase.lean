/-- Every morphism between schemes over a quasi-compact, quasi-separated base,
with separated finite-type source and separated quasi-compact target over that base,
has a compactification with quasi-compact open immersion.

Proof, following the source proof:
1. Write the structure morphisms `X ↘ S` and `Y ↘ S`; `f.IsOver S` identifies
their composite with `f`. Finite type means locally of finite type and quasi-compact. Separatedness
of `Y ↘ S` implies quasi-separatedness. Clause (2) of `lem-weil-pbc-qcqs-morphism-permanence` gives
quasi-compactness of both `X` and `Y` from quasi-compactness of their structure maps and of `S`, and
quasi-separatedness of `Y` from that of its structure map and of `S`.
2. Clause (b) of `lem-weil-pbc-separated-cancellation` gives separatedness of
`f` from that of `X ↘ S`. Clause (f) of `lem-weil-pbc-proper-fp-permanence`
gives local finite type of `f` from that of `X ↘ S`. Clause (1) of
`lem-weil-pbc-qcqs-morphism-permanence` gives quasi-compactness of `f` because
`X` is quasi-compact and `Y` is quasi-separated. Thus `f` is of finite type.
3. Apply `theorem-nagata-s-compactification-theorem--1` to `f` over the qcqs base `Y` to get
a dense compactification. Its open immersion is quasi-compact, its structure
map is proper, and their composite is `f`. Forget density to obtain an object of
`BoundaryCompactification f`. The argument uses the statement dependencies
`definition-compactification-refinement`, `def-weil-scheme-over-base`,
`def-weil-finite-type-morphism`, `def-weil-proper-morphism`, `def-weil-quasi-separated-morphism`,
and `def-weil-pbc-quasi-compact-scheme`, and the proof dependencies
`lem-pc-separated-quasi-separated`, `lem-weil-pbc-qcqs-morphism-permanence`,
`lem-weil-pbc-separated-cancellation`, `lem-weil-pbc-proper-fp-permanence`, and
`theorem-nagata-s-compactification-theorem--1`. -/
