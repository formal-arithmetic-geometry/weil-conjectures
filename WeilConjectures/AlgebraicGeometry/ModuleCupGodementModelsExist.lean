/-- A single coefficient sheaf has an augmented concrete Godement model.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0FKR; Banerjee, arXiv:1004.1491, §1.1.4.
Proof: the stalk functor to families of modules has right adjoint given by the
product of stalk skyscrapers. The hom equivalence is the product of the
`skyscraperHomEquiv` equivalences. Its unit is `moduleCup_godementUnit`, its
functorial action is `moduleCup_godementMap`, and its multiplication is
`moduleCup_godementMultiply`: project to the point coordinate and evaluate
its stalk. The two adjunction triangle identities imply the two unit laws,
and naturality of evaluation gives associativity. Set A in degree n to the
(n+1)-fold iterate of this functor on F, insert the unit for cofaces, and
multiplication for codegeneracies. The monad laws and naturality give the
cosimplicial relations, hence define A on every simplex map by its unique
order-preserving surjection/injection factorization. The recursive insertion
and collapse formulas are exactly its cofaces and codegeneracies. The germ
map into A in degree zero is killed by the alternating first differential,
since its two composites are equal by naturality of the unit. It therefore
defines the augmentation from F[0], with all other components zero. Extension
by zero and the single-object isomorphism give the stated augmentation
identity. This construction applies to empty schemes (empty products) and to
zero sheaves without additional choices. -/
