/-- (blueprint: lem-kun-stalks-commute-colimits) Let `T` be a scheme and `s` a geometric
point of `T`. The geometric stalk of sheaves of abelian groups on the small etale
site of `T` commutes with arbitrary colimits. In each degree the same holds for
complexes of abelian sheaves, whose colimits are computed termwise.

The stalk functor is left adjoint to the skyscraper sheaf functor, so it
preserves colimits (Mathlib `Point.skyscraperSheafAdjunction`). To obtain colimits
in the source sheaf category at the indicated universe, factor the forgetful
functor from integer modules through abelian groups: its first factor preserves
all colimits, and its second factor preserves filtered colimits. Mathlib's affine
etale sheafification instances then supply colimits of sheaves. Finally,
`HomologicalComplex.preservesColimitsOfShape_of_eval`, through the instance in
`HomologicalComplexAbelian`, gives preservation degreewise for each diagram shape.
