# The reduced closed subscheme on a set of points of an affine scheme

For a commutative ring `R` and a set `Z` of points of `Spec R`, the reduced closed subscheme with
support the closure of `Z` is `Spec (R ⧸ I(Z))`, `I(Z)` the vanishing ideal
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.reducedClosed`). It is reduced, its closed immersion into `Spec R` has
image the closure of `Z`, and the kernel of the map on global sections is `I(Z)`.
