# Regular schemes

A scheme is *regular* if all of its local rings are regular local rings. Mathlib has the
predicate `IsRegularLocalRing` on commutative rings but no class for schemes, so it is
introduced here; it is a hypothesis of the divisor sequence and of Grothendieck's residue
injection for the Brauer group.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.isRegularLocalRing_stalk_of_etale`: a scheme étale over a regular scheme
  is regular.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.isRegularLocalRing_stalk_pullback`: a product of regular schemes locally
  of finite type over a perfect field is regular.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsRegular.of_smooth`: a scheme smooth over a field is regular.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.smooth_of_isRegular`: a regular scheme locally of finite type over a perfect
  field is smooth over it.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsRegular.of_isIntegrallyClosed_stalk`: a locally noetherian scheme of
  dimension at most one whose local rings are integrally closed domains is regular.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.isIntegrallyClosed_stalk_of_isRegular`: conversely, the local rings of a
  regular locally noetherian scheme of dimension at most one are integrally closed.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsRegular.irreducibleSpace`: a connected locally noetherian regular scheme
  is irreducible.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GeometricallyIrreducible.of_smooth_of_geometricallyConnected`: a smooth
  morphism with geometrically connected fibres has geometrically irreducible fibres.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsRegular.isRegularRing_stalk`: the local rings of a regular scheme are
  regular rings, i.e. all their localizations at primes are regular local rings.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsRegular.uniqueFactorizationMonoid_stalk`: the local rings of a regular
  scheme are unique factorization domains.
