/-- A stalk of an affine morphism of finite presentation is essentially finitely presented
over the corresponding base stalk.

Proof: let A = Gamma(Y), B = Gamma(X), and phi = g.appTop. The affine stalks
are R = A_p and S = B_q, where p is the contraction of q under phi. Put
M = phi(A minus p) and P = M inverse B. Localization of the finitely presented
map phi gives a finitely presented map R to P. Since M is contained in B minus q,
localization transitivity makes S a localization of P at the image of B minus q.
The localization universal property defines both algebra structures. Check their
composite against the original stalk map on germs from A; localization extensionality
and the germ-stalk-map equation give the required scalar tower.
