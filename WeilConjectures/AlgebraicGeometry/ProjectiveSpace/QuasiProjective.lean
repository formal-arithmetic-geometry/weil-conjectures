# Quasi-projectivity descends along field extensions

Over a field `k`, a scheme `X` is quasi-projective precisely when it admits an immersion over
`Spec k` into a projective space `ℙ(β; Spec k)` with finitely many homogeneous coordinates; this
is the form in which quasi-projectivity is phrased here.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsQuasiProjective`: a scheme over a field is quasi-projective if it admits
  an immersion into a projective space.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isImmersion_projectiveSpace_of_pullback`: if the base change `X_K`
  of a `k`-scheme `X` to a field extension `K / k` is quasi-projective over `K`, then `X` is
  quasi-projective over `k` (Stacks 0BDE).

/-- A scheme `X` over a field `k`, with structure morphism `f`, is *quasi-projective* if it
admits an immersion over `Spec k`, that is a locally closed immersion, into a projective space
`ℙ(β; Spec k)` with finitely many homogeneous coordinates; equivalently, an open immersion into
a closed subscheme of such a projective space. (blueprint: `def-sc-quasi-projective`) -/

/-- **Quasi-projectivity descends along field extensions** (Stacks 0BDE). Let `K / k` be a field
extension and let `X` be a scheme over `k`. If the base change `X_K` admits an immersion over
`Spec K` into a projective space `ℙ(α; Spec K)` with finitely many homogeneous coordinates, then
`X` admits an immersion over `Spec k` into a projective space `ℙ(β; Spec k)` with finitely many
homogeneous coordinates.

The proof follows Stacks 0BDE. The pullback of `𝒪(1)` along the immersion is ample: there is a
morphism `X_K ⟶ ℙ(γ; K)` with affine preimages of the standard opens
(`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isAffineOpen_preimage_of_isImmersion`). Such a morphism is defined
over a finite extension `k'` of `k`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_finite_isAffineOpen_preimage_standardOpen`); taking norms along
`X_{k'} ⟶ X` gives an ample coordinate cover of `X`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_coordinateCover_of_isPullback`), and an ample coordinate cover of a
scheme of finite type gives an immersion into projective space
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.CoordinateCover.exists_isImmersion`).

This is an input to the proof of Stacks 0BF7 (`AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.exists_isImmersion_
projectiveSpace`), used for blueprint `lem-sc-abelian-variety-projective` and the subsection
`sk-prop-av-projective`. -/
