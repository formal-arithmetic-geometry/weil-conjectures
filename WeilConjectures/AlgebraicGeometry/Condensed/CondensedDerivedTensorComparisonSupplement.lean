/-! # The canonical derived finite coefficient tensor comparison

This construction is the comparison already used by the two-colimit cocone, placed
below that cocone so coefficient complex presentations can state its naturality.
The functor and Hom-equivalence names cache the derived constructions, avoiding
repeated elaboration of their resolution and localization data.
