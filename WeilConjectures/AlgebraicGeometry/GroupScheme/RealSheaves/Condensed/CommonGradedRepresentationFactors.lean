/-- Choose a composition series in every common graded piece. Refinement matches both sets of
composition factors with the same disjoint union; compose the two bijections and their factor
isomorphisms. Every irreducible subquotient occurs in a composition series, so these same
bijections also give both constituent inclusions. -/
