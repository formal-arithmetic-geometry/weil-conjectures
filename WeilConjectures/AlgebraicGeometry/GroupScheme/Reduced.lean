# The reduced subgroup scheme

Let `G` be a group scheme locally of finite type over a perfect field `k` (e.g. an algebraically
closed one). Products of reduced `k`-schemes are reduced, so the multiplication, unit and inverse
of `G` restricted to the reduced subscheme `G_red` factor through `G_red`: it is a closed subgroup
scheme, and, being reduced, it is smooth over `k`.

This reduces the ampleness statement of Stacks 0BF7 to smooth group schemes: in characteristic
zero `G` itself is reduced by Cartier's theorem, and in characteristic `p` an ample family on
`G_red` descends to `G` along the Frobenius (Stacks 0BD4).

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.reduced`: the reduced subscheme `G_red` of `G`, as a `k`-scheme, with
  its closed immersion `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.reducedι : G_red ⟶ G`; it carries a group
  structure making `reducedι` a homomorphism.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.smooth_of_grpObj_of_isReduced`: a reduced group scheme locally of finite type
  over a perfect field is smooth.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.exists_isAffineOpen_compl_support_zeroLocus_of_smooth`: if every
  smooth group scheme of finite type over an algebraically closed field `k` carries an ample
  family, so does every group scheme of finite type over `k`.

/-- **Reduction of Stacks 0BF7 to smooth group schemes.** Let `k` be algebraically closed. If
every smooth group scheme of finite type over `k` carries an invertible module with finitely many
sections whose non-vanishing loci are affine and cover it, then so does every group scheme `G` of
finite type over `k`.

In characteristic zero, `G` is reduced by Cartier's theorem
(`AlgebraicGeometry.isReduced_of_grpObj`), hence smooth. In characteristic `p`, the reduced
subgroup scheme `G_red` is smooth and carries such a family, which descends to `G` along the
Frobenius (`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isAffineOpen_compl_support_zeroLocus_of_nilradical`,
Stacks 0BD4). -/
