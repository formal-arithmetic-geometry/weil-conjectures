# Group schemes of finite type over a field are quasi-projective

A group scheme of finite type over a field `k` is quasi-projective over `k` (Stacks 0BF7).
Over a field, quasi-projectivity amounts to an immersion into a projective space `ℙ(α; Spec k)`
with finitely many homogeneous coordinates, and this is the form in which it is stated here.

Following Stacks 0BF7, the statement is reduced to the case of an algebraically closed field:
the base change of `G` to an algebraic closure `K` of `k` is again a group scheme of finite type,
and quasi-projectivity descends from `K` to `k`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isImmersion_projectiveSpace_of_pullback`, Stacks 0BDE).

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.exists_isImmersion_projectiveSpace_of_isAlgClosed`: the case of an
  algebraically closed field.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.exists_isImmersion_projectiveSpace`: a group scheme of finite type
  over a field admits an immersion into a projective space over the field.

/-- **Group schemes of finite type over an algebraically closed field carry an ample invertible
module.** A group scheme `G` of finite type over an algebraically closed field `k` carries an
invertible module `ℒ` with finitely many global sections `s i` whose non-vanishing loci `G_{s i}`
are affine and cover `G`; that is, `ℒ` is ample in the sense of Stacks 01PS.

This is the geometric core of Stacks 0BF7. One reduces to `G` smooth
(`AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.exists_isAffineOpen_compl_support_zeroLocus_of_smooth`: Cartier's
theorem in characteristic zero, `G_red` and Frobenius in characteristic `p`), then to the
identity component (`AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.hasAmpleFamily_of_identityComponent`), and treats
the smooth irreducible case with translates of a divisor with affine complement
(`AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.hasAmpleFamily_of_smooth_of_irreducibleSpace`). -/

/-- **Group schemes of finite type over an algebraically closed field are quasi-projective.**
A group scheme `G` of finite type over an algebraically closed field `k` admits an immersion
`G ⟶ ℙ(α; Spec k)` over `Spec k` into a projective space with finitely many homogeneous
coordinates.

`G` is separated over `k` (`AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.isSeparated_hom`, Stacks 047L) and carries
an ample invertible module
(`AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.exists_isAffineOpen_compl_support_zeroLocus`), whose sections give the
immersion (`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isImmersion_projectiveSpace_of_isAffineOpen`). It is the
input of `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.exists_isImmersion_projectiveSpace`, used for blueprint
`lem-sc-abelian-variety-projective` and the subsection `sk-prop-av-projective`. -/

finite type over a field `k` admits an immersion `G ⟶ ℙ(α; Spec k)` over `Spec k` into a

The base change of `G` to an algebraic closure of `k` is a group scheme of finite type over an
algebraically closed field, hence quasi-projective
(`AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.exists_isImmersion_projectiveSpace_of_isAlgClosed`), and
quasi-projectivity descends along field extensions (Stacks 0BDE).
