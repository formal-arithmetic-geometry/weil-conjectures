# The Lie algebra of a group scheme

This module only re-exports its parts, which live in
`WeilConjectures.AlgebraicGeometry.GroupScheme.Lie`; it was split to keep the compilation of each
part cheap.

Let `G` be a group scheme over a scheme `S`, with structure morphism `f : G ⟶ S`, identity
section `e : S ⟶ G` and multiplication `m : G ×_S G ⟶ G`. Set `ω_{G/S} = e^*Ω¹_{G/S}`. The *Lie
algebra sheaf* of `G/S` is the `𝒪_S`-module

$$
\operatorname{Lie}(G/S) = \mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal O_S}(\omega_{G/S}, \mathcal O_S),
$$

the sheaf of relative tangent vectors along the identity section, and the *Lie algebra*
`Lie(G) = Hom_{𝒪_S}(ω_{G/S}, 𝒪_S)` is its module of global sections. When `G ⟶ S` is smooth,
`ω_{G/S}` is locally free and `Lie(G/S) ≅ e^*T_{G/S}` is the pullback of the tangent sheaf; for an
arbitrary group scheme the dual-of-cotangent definition is the right one.

## Infinitesimal points

The dual-number thickening `S[ε]` of the base (`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.dualNumbers`) is a scheme
over `S` through the projection `p : S[ε] ⟶ S`, and the closed immersion `i : S ⟶ S[ε]`, `ε ↦ 0`,
is a section of `p`. The *infinitesimal points* of `G` are the points `v : S[ε] ⟶ G` over `S` with
`i ≫ v = e`; they form a normal subgroup `infPoints G` of the group `G(S[ε])`, whose group law is
the addition of tangent vectors. A point `v` has the same underlying map as `e`, and on functions
`v^♯(a) = e^♯(a) + ε d_v(a)`; the `ε`-coefficient `d_v` is a derivation `𝒪_G → e_*𝒪_S` over
`f⁻¹𝒪_S`, that is a morphism `Ω¹_{G/S} ⟶ e_*𝒪_S`, that is an element of
`Lie(G) = Hom(e^*Ω¹_{G/S}, 𝒪_S)`. This is the bridge `GrpObj.toLie : infPoints G → Lie G`, a
bijection (`GrpObj.lieEquiv`).

## The bracket

For a group scheme `G` over a field `k`, write `G(R)⁰` for the points of `G` with values in a
local `k`-algebra `R` with residue field `k` that reduce to the identity
(`GrpObj.pointsKer`). Tangent vectors are the points `1 + εX` over `k[ε]`
(`GrpObj.lieEquivTangent`). Over `k[ε][δ]`, the commutator `(1 + εX)(1 + δY)(1 + εX)⁻¹(1 + δY)⁻¹`
reduces to the identity modulo `ε` and modulo `δ`, hence is `1 + εδ Z` for a unique tangent
vector `Z = [X, Y]` (`GrpObj.tangentBracket`). This is the Lie bracket of `Lie(G)`; the Jacobi
identity is the Hall–Witt identity over `k[α][β][γ]`. For `G = GL_n` it is the matrix commutator,
and `Lie(GL_n) = gl_n`; see `WeilConjectures.AlgebraicGeometry.GroupScheme.GeneralLinear.Lie`, and
`WeilConjectures.AlgebraicGeometry.GroupScheme.GeneralLinear.ClosedSubgroup.Lie` for the Lie
algebras of the closed subgroup schemes of `GL_n`.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.unitSection`, `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.omega`,
  `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.lieAlgebraSheaf`: the identity section, `ω_{G/S}` and `Lie(G/S)`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.Lie`: the Lie algebra `Lie(G) = Hom(ω_{G/S}, 𝒪_S)`, a module over
  `Γ(S, 𝒪_S)`, and over `R` when `S = Spec R`, with its `LieRing` and `LieAlgebra k` structures
  over a field `k`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.infPoints`: the infinitesimal points `ker(G(S[ε]) → G(S))`, and the
  bridge `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.lieEquiv : infPoints G ≃ Lie G`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.differential`: the differential `Lie(G) →ₗ⁅k⁆ Lie(H)` of a
  homomorphism of group schemes over a field `k`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.tangentGroup`, `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.infPointsEquivTangentGroup`: for `G`
  over `Spec R`, the infinitesimal points are the points with values in the ring of dual numbers
  `R[ε]` reducing to the identity.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.lieEquivIdentityComponent`: `Lie(G°) = Lie(G)` for a group scheme of
  finite type over a field.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.lieAlgebraSheaf_iso_pullback_tangentSheaf`: for smooth `G ⟶ S`,
  `Lie(G/S) ≅ e^*T_{G/S}`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.differential_injective`: a monomorphism of group schemes has an
  injective differential; `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.differential_bijective_of_isOpenImmersion`: an
  open immersion of group schemes has a bijective differential.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.lie_mem_range_differential_of_commutator_mem`: if the commutators of
  `H` factor through a subgroup scheme `G ⟶ H`, then the brackets of tangent vectors of `H` are
  tangent to `G`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.range_differential_le_center`: the tangent vectors of a central
  subgroup scheme are central in the Lie algebra.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.finrank_lie_eq_topologicalKrullDim`: in characteristic zero the Lie
  algebra has the dimension of the group (Cartier's theorem).

## Implementation notes

All constructions are genuine definitions. The bridge `toLie` is a bijection: its inverse sends a
derivation `d : 𝒪_G → e_*𝒪_S` to the point `GrpObj.pointOfDerivation`, `a ↦ e^♯(a) + ε d(a)`.
The bracket is only defined over a field, where the points over Artinian local `k`-algebras
are determined by their maps on the local ring at the identity. The base ring of a group scheme
over an affine base is written `R`; `k` is reserved for a field.

## Blueprint

- `sk-d-tangent`: the Lie algebra of an algebraic group as its tangent space at the identity.
- `sk-i-cartier`: the Lie algebra clauses of Cartier's theorem.
- `sk-p-comparison`: the Lie algebra of a central subgroup scheme.
