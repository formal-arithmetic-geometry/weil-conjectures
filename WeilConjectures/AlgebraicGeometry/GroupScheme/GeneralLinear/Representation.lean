# Algebraic-group modules

An *algebraic-group module* of a group scheme `G` over a field `k` is a finite-dimensional vector
space `k^m` with a homomorphism of group schemes `r : G ⟶ GL_m`, a rational representation
(`AlgebraicGeometry.GeneralLinearGroup.RationalHom`). The `k`-points of `G` act on `k^m` through
`r`; this is the representation `RationalHom.representation`, and the stable subspaces, the
simple and the semisimple algebraic-group modules are those of this representation.

Simple and semisimple modules are only defined for `k` algebraically closed of characteristic `0`,
the setting of the blueprint. There `G(k)` is schematically dense in an algebraic group `G`, so
stability under `G(k)` is stability under `G`; over a general field it is not.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.GeneralLinearGroup.RationalHom.representation`: the representation of
  `G(k)` on `k^m` given by a rational representation.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GeneralLinearGroup.RationalHom.IsSimple`: simple algebraic-group modules.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GeneralLinearGroup.RationalHom.IsSemisimple`: semisimple algebraic-group
  modules.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.GeneralLinearGroup.RationalHom.isSimple_iff`: a module is simple if and only
  if it is nonzero and has no nonzero proper stable subspace.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.GeneralLinearGroup.RationalHom.isSemisimple_iff`: a module is semisimple if
  and only if it is a direct sum of simple modules.

## Blueprint

- `sk-d-linear`: coefficients and representations; the constructions on representations it
  lists are Mathlib's `Representation`, `Subrepresentation`, `Representation.IsIrreducible`,
  `Representation.IsSemisimpleRepresentation`, `Representation.tprod` and
  `Representation.exteriorPower`.
- `def-wf-algebraic-representations`: `RationalHom` and `RationalHom.representation`.
- `def-wf-simple-module`: `RationalHom.IsSimple`.
- `def-wf-semisimple-module`: `RationalHom.IsSemisimple`.

/-- A *simple* algebraic-group module: `k^m` is nonzero and has no nonzero proper subspace stable
under `G` (`RationalHom.isSimple_iff`). (blueprint: `def-wf-simple-module`)

Stability is tested on the `k`-points `G(k)` only. This is the scheme-theoretic notion (a
subcomodule, i.e. stable under `G(R)` for every `k`-algebra `R`) because `G` is an algebraic
group, i.e. locally of finite type over `k`, and `k` is algebraically closed of characteristic
`0`, the standing hypotheses of `sk-d-linear`: then `G` is reduced (Cartier) and `G(k)` is
schematically dense in `G`. Without these hypotheses the two notions differ, which is why
`[LocallyOfFiniteType G.hom] [IsAlgClosed k] [CharZero k]` are imposed. -/

/-- A *semisimple* algebraic-group module: a direct sum of simple modules
(`RationalHom.isSemisimple_iff`). (blueprint: `def-wf-semisimple-module`)

As for `RationalHom.IsSimple`, testing stability on `G(k)` agrees with the scheme-theoretic notion
because `G` is locally of finite type over `k` and `k` is algebraically closed of characteristic
`0`; without these hypotheses it does not. -/
