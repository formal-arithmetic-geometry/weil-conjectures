# Cartier's theorem: group schemes in characteristic zero are smooth

**Cartier's theorem** states that every group scheme locally of finite type over a field `K` of
characteristic zero is reduced, and hence smooth over `K`.

A group scheme over `K` is a scheme `G` with a structure morphism `f : G ⟶ Spec K` making
`Over.mk f` a group object of the category of `K`-schemes, that is, carrying

```
  G ×_{Spec K} G --- mul ---> G <--- one --- Spec K
```

together with an inverse `G ⟶ G`, all of them morphisms over `Spec K`.

Mathlib provides `AlgebraicGeometry.smooth_of_grpObj`: a group scheme locally of finite type over
a field which is *geometrically* reduced is smooth over that field.  In characteristic zero the
base field is perfect, so reducedness and geometric reducedness agree; Mathlib does not yet have
that implication (`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Geometrically/Reduced.lean` only goes the easy way),
so the smoothness half is stated separately below rather than derived here.

## Main statements

* `AlgebraicGeometry.GrpObj.exists_derivation_of_isOpenImmersion`: on an affine open subscheme
  `Spec A` of a group scheme, every tangent vector at a rational point extends to a derivation of
  `A` (invariant vector fields).
* `AlgebraicGeometry.isReduced_of_grpObj`: a group scheme locally of finite type over a field of
  characteristic zero is reduced.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.smooth_of_grpObj_of_charZero`: such a group scheme is smooth over the base
  field.

## Blueprint

`AlgebraicGeometry.isReduced_of_grpObj` and `AlgebraicGeometry.smooth_of_grpObj_of_charZero`
implement `sk-i-cartier`.

The result is due to Cartier, *Questions de rationalité des diviseurs en géométrie algébrique*
(1958).

/-- **Invariant vector fields.** Let `G` be a group scheme over a field `K` and let
`j : Spec A ⟶ G` be an affine open subscheme. Every tangent vector of `A` at a `K`-point `e` of
`A`, given as a linear form `φ` on the cotangent space `𝔪/𝔪²` at `e`, extends to a derivation `D`
of `A`.

Let `x` be the rational point of `G` given by `e` and `v : Spec K[ε] ⟶ G` the tangent vector.
The morphism `Φ : Spec A[ε] ⟶ G`, `(g, t) ↦ g x⁻¹ v(t)`, restricts to the inclusion `j` along
`Spec A ⟶ Spec A[ε]`; as `Spec A[ε]` and `Spec A` have the same points, `Φ` factors through
`j`, as `Spec ψ` for a section `ψ : A → A[ε]`, `ψ a = a + D(a) ε`, of the reduction modulo `ε`.
Evaluating at `x` recovers `v`, so `e ∘ D` is the derivation `φ`. -/

Let `Spec A ⟶ G` be an affine open subscheme and `b` a nilpotent element of `A`. Every maximal
ideal of `A` is the kernel of a `K`-point `e`, and every tangent vector of `A` at `e` extends to a
derivation of `A` (`GrpObj.exists_derivation_of_isOpenImmersion`). By Cartier's lemma
(`AlgHom.exists_apply_eq_one_mul_eq_zero_of_forall_exists_derivation`) the annihilator of `b` is
not contained in the kernel of `e`. Hence it is the unit ideal and `b = 0`.
