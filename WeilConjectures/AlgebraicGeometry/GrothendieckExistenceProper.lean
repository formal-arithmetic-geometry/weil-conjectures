/-- Completion of coherent modules on a proper scheme over an I-adically complete
Noetherian ring is an equivalence. The kernel ideal of Spec(A/I) → Spec(A) is the ideal
sheaf associated to I; its `comap f` is I O_X. The Noetherian structure on X is supplied
by `isNoetherian_of_locallyOfFiniteType f`, rather than an additional hypothesis.
Source: Stacks Project, Proposition 088C; EGA III_1, Theorem 5.1.4.

Proof:
1. Properness and the Noetherian base make X Noetherian. Completion is fully faithful by
   lem-weil-pbc-formal-completion-fully-faithful-proper.
2. If essential surjectivity fails, Noetherian ACC gives a maximal quasi-coherent ideal
   for which algebraization fails. Replace X by its closed subscheme; it is nonempty,
   and every strictly larger ideal algebraizes.
3. Every nonzero ideal on this replacement cuts out a subscheme on which completion is
   an equivalence: maximality gives essential surjectivity and properness gives full
   faithfulness. Equal-ideal closed immersions identify the corresponding subschemes.
4. Chow's lemma gives a proper surjective projective modification, an isomorphism over
   a dense open. The immersion into projective space is
   closed by properness.
5. Pull back the formal system and algebraize it on that projective scheme.
6. Push forward the resulting coherent module. The push-pull comparison has kernel
   and cokernel killed by a power of the ideal of the reduced closed complement.
7. Every positive power of this complement ideal is nonzero: on the nonempty dense
   open it is the unit ideal. Thus step 3 applies to all its thickenings.
8. Devissage algebraizes the original system, contradicting maximality. Essential surjectivity and step 1
   give the claimed equivalence. -/
