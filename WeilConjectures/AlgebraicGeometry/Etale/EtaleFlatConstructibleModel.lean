# Bounded flat constructible models on the small etale site

This statement uses the recorded finite-constant-value constructibility predicate, both
on cohomology sheaves and on the terms of the model.

/-- Over a finite commutative ring on a Noetherian scheme, a bounded constructible etale
complex has Tor amplitude in `[a,b]`, with `a ≤ b`, exactly when it has a flat constructible
model supported in that same interval.

Proof plan:
1. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-constructible-etale-module-sheaf-comparison` to every cohomology
   sheaf, converting the finite-value predicate to `Scheme.IsConstructibleSheaf`.
   Let `T` be this source predicate and `S` its conjunction with flatness.
2. By the kernel and cokernel clauses of `thm-constructible-serre`, and the comparison
   on the source, target and resulting sheaf, `T` is closed under kernels and cokernels.
3. Zero sheaves are constant with zero value on the one-stratum partition, and
   isomorphisms preserve stratum trivializations and flatness. Tensor with zero is exact.
   The split exact sequence for a binary biproduct, `thm-constructible-serre`, and the
   comparison give its constructibility; `lem-weil-pbc-flat-coproduct` gives its flatness.
   Thus `S` contains zero, is invariant under isomorphisms and binary biproducts, and
   is contained in both `T` and the flat objects.
4. The lifting condition for `S,T` is `lem-sf-etale-flat-constructible-lifting`: lift a
   map from a constructible sheaf along an epimorphism after an epimorphic cover by a
   flat constructible sheaf. This does not require the original sheaf to be flat.
5. Given Tor amplitude, apply `lem-sf-flat-model-class-resolution` with these classes.
   The result is supported in `[a,b]`, with flat terms in `T`, and isomorphic to `K`.
   Its lower good truncation term is a constructible cokernel. Invert the isomorphism
   and apply the comparison to each term to obtain finite-value constructibility.
6. Conversely forget termwise constructibility and apply the reverse direction of
   `lem-sf-etale-flat-model`, converting the bounded-constructibility hypothesis using
   the same comparison. Bounded constructibility alone is not finite Tor amplitude. -/
