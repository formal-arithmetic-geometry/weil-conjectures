/-- Scalar extension is restricted derived tensor and commutes with geometric pullback,
with the universal computation normalizations and the fixed section comparisons.

(1),
scalar-refined reduction comparison; Stacks Tags 03EK, 06YS, 06YY, 0G7E, 0D6D,

Proof (the eight steps of the node):
1. Use lem-pe-internal-section-tensor-comparison,
lem-sfb-internal-section-scalar-adjunction, and the section derived pushpull and tensor
normalizations to transport the actual operations and their universal computation maps.
2. The ordinary extension/tensor comparison followed by symmetry sends s tensor x to
x tensor s. Balancing gives its inverse. The single degree-zero total comparison has
only the (n,0) summand, with no sign.
3. On a flat-term K-flat P, compose the restricted scalar computation counit, the
localized ordinary comparison, and the inverse tensor localization map. The counit is
invertible by lem-pur-derived-change-of-rings; the tensor map is invertible with just
one K-flat factor by lem-sf-ringed-derived-native-tensor. Descend through
lem-weil-pbc-site-derived-tensor-descent.
4. For an arbitrary complex A choose a flat-term K-flat resolution P to A using
lem-pc-kflat-resolution. Naturality and cancellation of the derived image of this
quasi-isomorphism prove TensorNormalized at A; tensoring the resolution need not be
invertible.
5. Naturality of the coefficient isomorphism pulled from the point makes the ring-map
square commute. The internal inverse-image comparison and
lem-sfb-kflat-scalar-comparison-normalization identify its balanced map on generators.
6. The ordinary map is the inverse of the specified pullIso: its transpose is
comapLowerStarIso, since units insert 1 and counits multiply. Uniqueness in
lem-weil-pbc-conjugate-iso-unit-equation identifies this particular conjugate.
7. Ringed pullback preserves flat-term K-flat complexes, including coefficient change
without flatness. Descend the balanced comparison and use step 6. Naturality and
cancellation as in step 4 give PullNormalized on all homotopy complexes.
8. The fixed scalar and geometric section comparisons preserve the actual derived
Hom transposes, units and counits. Their representative squares give the section-ring
K-flat formulas for both normalized maps. Descent proves naturality and independence
of representatives. Identity maps, zero target rings, nonflat quotients, unbounded
complexes and empty schemes are all included. -/
