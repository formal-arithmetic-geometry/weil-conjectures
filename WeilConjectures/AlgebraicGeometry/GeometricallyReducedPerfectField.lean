/-! # Reduced schemes of finite type over a perfect field

A reduced scheme locally of finite type over a perfect field `k` stays reduced after every
field extension; its structure morphism is flat, locally of finite presentation and has
geometrically reduced fibres.

/-- let `X` be a reduced scheme locally of
finite type over a perfect field `k`. Then for every field extension `L / k` the base change
`X_L` is reduced, and `X ⟶ Spec k` is flat, locally of finite presentation and geometrically
reduced.

Proof: geometric reducedness over a perfect field is `GeometricallyReduced.of_perfectField`,
which gives reducedness of `X_L`; every morphism to the spectrum of a field is flat
(`Flat.of_field`); and `Spec k` is Noetherian, so locally of finite type is the same as locally
of finite presentation. -/
