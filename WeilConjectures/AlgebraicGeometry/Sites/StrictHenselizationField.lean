# The strict henselization of a field

Let `K` be a field and `Ω` a separably closed field, algebraic over `K`, viewed as a geometric
point `s : Spec Ω ⟶ Spec K`. The strict henselization `𝒪^{sh}_{Spec K, s}` is a field: the
evaluation `𝒪^{sh}_{Spec K, s} ⟶ Ω` is injective
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.strictHenselizationEval_injective_of_field`), since the rings of the
pointed étale neighbourhoods are finite products of fields. Its image contains the separable
closure of `K` in `Ω` (`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.exists_strictHenselizationEval_eq_of_isSeparable`)
so that `Ω` is purely inseparable over it, and `Spec Ω ⟶ Spec K_(s)` is a universal
homeomorphism (`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.isUniversalHomeomorphism_spec_strictHenselizationEval`).
