# Adic derived inverse limits with a chosen Roos triangle

Source: Stacks Project, Derived Categories, Tags 08TC and 0H9J.

## Main definitions

- `adicReductionSequence`: the scalar-restricted reductions, indexed from zero.
- `adicReductionStep`: the quotient-induced successive transition maps.
- `adicReductionTower`: the resulting inverse system.
- `AdicDerivedInverseLimit`: an object and chosen maps forming its Roos triangle.

The model parameter uses the recorded coefficient construction. Every derived object
admits such a model by `adicKFlatModel_exists`; no boundedness condition is imposed.
No derived-limit object, morphism between triples, or functor is selected.
