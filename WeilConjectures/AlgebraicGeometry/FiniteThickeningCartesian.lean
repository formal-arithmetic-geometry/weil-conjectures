/-- Finiteness is equivalent before and after base change along a finite order thickening.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 09ZW, part (8).

Proof:
1. If `f'` is finite, its base change is finite.
2. Nilpotence of `i.ker` gives full support, hence surjectivity of the closed immersion
   `i`. Its base change to `X'` is a surjective closed immersion.
   Thus the cartesian square is a morphism of thickenings, as in Stacks Tag 09ZU.
3. If the base change is finite, it is integral and locally of finite type.
4. Integrality lifts along this morphism of thickenings
   (lem-weil-pbc-thickening-integral, Stacks Tag 09ZV (5)).
5. Local finite type lifts along the cartesian finite order thickening
   (lem-weil-pbc-thickening-lft-cartesian, Stacks Tag 09ZW (2)).
6. Hence `f'` is integral and locally of finite type, and therefore finite. Together with step 1 this gives the equivalence. -/
