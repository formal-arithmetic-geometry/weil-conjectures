# Degree-two comparison for the multiplicative sheaf over a field

The cohomological Brauer group `H²(Spec K_ét, 𝔾ₘ)` of a field `K` is the second continuous
Galois cohomology of the units of a separable closure.

/-- The second étale cohomology of the multiplicative group over a field `K` is the second
continuous Galois cohomology of the units of the separable closure `Ks` of `K`.

This is `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.sheafHAddEquivContinuousCohomology` for `𝔾ₘ`, whose stalk
at the Galois point is identified with `Ksˣ` by evaluation of germs at the geometric point
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.gmSheafFiberGaloisPointAddEquiv`). It is the composite of the
comparison of étale cohomology over a field with `Ext` in discrete Galois modules
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.sheafHAddEquivGaloisH`) and the computation of this `Ext` by
continuous homogeneous cochains (`DiscreteModule.hAddEquivContinuousCohomology`). The stalk of
`𝔾ₘ` is the group of units of `Ks` even when `K` is imperfect. This additive equivalence and
its inverse supersede the former one-sided embeddings.
