/-- A formally unramified morphism admits a universal first order thickening.
The proof is the affine-open construction and gluing argument of Stacks, More on
Morphisms, Lemma 37.7.1 (Tag 04F3): choose affine pieces, construct their
universal thickenings from the square-zero algebra construction, identify the
overlap thickenings by uniqueness, glue the pieces and verify the universal
lifting property locally. This is the existence conjunct split from the target
theorem so that the target can combine it with the independent uniqueness
argument. -/
