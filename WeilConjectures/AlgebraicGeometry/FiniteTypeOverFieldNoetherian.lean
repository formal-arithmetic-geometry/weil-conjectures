# Noetherian spaces for schemes of finite type over a field

This small interface supplies the geometric hypothesis for the inherited shift on bounded
constructible complexes without importing the six-functor triangulatedness package.

/-- A scheme of finite type over a field has Noetherian underlying space.
Proof: the field spectrum is Noetherian. Local finite type therefore gives a locally
Noetherian source, and quasi-compactness of the structure map gives a compact source.
Together these make the source a Noetherian scheme, hence a Noetherian space. -/
