/-- Form the finite boundary predicate before specializing the abelian category.
The quotient is placed in degree zero and the root map in degree zero shifted by two.
The two supplied arrows retain exactly the endpoint transports of `finiteBoundaryEquality`.

Construction: apply the degree-zero single functor to the quotient and the root map,
shift the latter by two, and use these actual morphisms in `finiteBoundaryEquality`.
No choice of arrow or endpoint transport is added; unfolding gives the original predicate,
including its heterogeneous equalities and final ordinary equality. -/
