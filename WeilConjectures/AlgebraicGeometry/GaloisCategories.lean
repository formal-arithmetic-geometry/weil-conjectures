# Finite étale covers and finite locally constant sheaves

The category of finite étale covers is `Scheme.FiniteEtale`, supplied by the
source library.  This file supplies the corresponding category of finite locally
constant sheaves of finite sets.

/-- The category `FLC(Y)` of finite locally constant sheaves of finite sets on the
small étale site of `Y`, with morphisms of sheaves.

The predicate expands the definition of finite locally constant sheaf from
`def-weil-pbc-etale-sheaves`; the full subcategory supplies exactly the sheaf
morphisms as its arrows. -/
