# The total derived module-object pushforward and pullback
.

These are the general derived functors of the full underived composites. Naming their
specializations once shares the structural arguments in concrete coefficient statements.
The published derived adjunction, bounded-below version and resolution comparisons remain
publicly imported; no construction or choice of derived functors is replaced.
