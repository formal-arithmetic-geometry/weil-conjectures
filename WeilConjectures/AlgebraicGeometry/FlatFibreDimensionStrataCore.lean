/-- Fibrewise dense constant dimension opens.

Source: Stacks Project, Tags 054T and 054U.
Proof: For each n, take V n to be the interior of the set of points over U with
local topological fibre dimension n. At a component generic point z of any fibre,
the fibre stalk has dimension zero: its closure is a maximal irreducible closed
set, so its coheight in the specialization order is zero, and stalk dimension
is coheight. The zero-dimensional-stalk neighbourhood theorem gives an open W
around the image of z on which fibre dimension is some fixed n. Since W is open
and lies in the corresponding dimension level set, it is contained in V n.
Thus the inverse-image union contains every component generic point of the
fibre. Generic points are dense in any sober space, so the union is dense.
Membership in V n implies membership in the dimension level set, giving the
second conclusion. No family of opens is chosen from an unproved existence
theorem: V is constructed using interiors. Empty fibres satisfy density. -/
