/-- The polynomial-to-Laurent inclusion commutes with the structure maps to `Spec k`.

Proof: write `u: k[t] → k[t,t⁻¹]` for the polynomial-to-Laurent map and `c_P`, `c_L`
for the respective constant maps from `k`. The image under `u` of `c_P(a)` has coefficient
`a` at exponent zero and zero at every other exponent, including negative exponents.
Thus `u(c_P(a)) = c_L(a)` for every `a`, including zero. Extensionality gives
`u ∘ c_P = c_L`. By the defining formulas for `KummerLine.inclusion` and
`KummerLine.structureMap`, contravariant functoriality of `Spec` identifies the left
side of the asserted equation with `Spec(u ∘ c_P)`. Substitution gives `Spec(c_L)`,
which is the structure map of the punctured line. -/
