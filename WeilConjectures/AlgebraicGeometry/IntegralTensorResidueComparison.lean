/-- Derived reduction of an ordinary tensor is the tensor of the two reductions
over the residue coefficient ring, rather than over the integral coefficient ring.

Proof: compute the two derived objects on K-flat representatives P and Q. Ordinary
extension of scalars along the fixed quotient O_E -> O_E/pi_E is strong monoidal:
(P tensor Q) tensor O_E/pi_E identifies with
(P tensor O_E/pi_E) tensor_{O_E/pi_E} (Q tensor O_E/pi_E) by scalar associativity.
Extension sends K-flat representatives to K-flat representatives, and the direct-sum
total complexes have the same tensor associators. Localize this balanced comparison;
its inverse is the inverse balanced comparison. The derived comparison is independent
of the K-flat representatives by their quasi-isomorphism comparison. This is the
identity-geometric-map instance of the canonical derived tensor pullback comparison.
There is no constructibility, completeness or flatness hypothesis on M or N. -/
