/-- A qcqs scheme locally of finite presentation over a limit with affine transitions
has a model at one stage, without hypotheses on the stages or on the limit.

Proof (node steps 1--10):
1. Fix `i₀`. Choose a finite affine open cover `X = ⋃ U_a` with `U_a` mapping into affine
   opens `W_{a,i₀} ⊆ S_{i₀}`; by the affine-transition limit theorem `W_a = lim_j W_{a,j}` with all terms affine, and
   `U_a → W_a` is of finite presentation (Tags 01TQ, 01KO). If `X` is empty take no charts.
2. Finite-presentation descent (Tag 01ZM) over the affine systems `(W_{a,j})` gives models
   `U_{a,i} → W_{a,i} ⊆ S_i`, affine after increasing `i` (Tag 01Z6), with isomorphisms
   `e_a: U_{a,i} ×_{S_i} S ≅ U_a` over `S`; no hypothesis on a whole stage is used.
3. Descend the quasi-compact overlaps `U_a ∩ U_b` to quasi-compact opens `O_{ab,i} ⊆ U_{a,i}`
   (Tag 01Z4), with `O_{aa,i} = U_{a,i}`; their systems are qcqs with affine transitions.
4. The maps `O_{ab,i} → S_i` and `U_{c,i} → S_i` are locally of finite presentation (Tag 01TR,
   open immersions), hence locally of finite type (Tag 01TQ).
5. Tag 01ZC over the fixed base `S_i` descends `e_b⁻¹ ∘ e_a` on overlaps to `S_i`-maps
   `φ_{ab,i}: O_{ab,i} → O_{ba,i}` via the fibre-product universal property; `φ_{aa,i} = id`.
6. Eventual equality of maps into a locally finite type target gives `φ_{ba} ∘ φ_{ab} = id`.
7. Tag 01Z4(2) gives the gluing domain equality `φ_{ab}⁻¹(O_{ba} ∩ O_{bc}) = O_{ab} ∩ O_{ac}`.
8. Eventual equality into `U_{c,i}` gives the cocycle `φ_{bc} ∘ φ_{ab} = φ_{ac}` on its domain.
9. Glue (Schemes 01JA/01JC) to `X_i` with `f_i: X_i → S_i`; `X_i` is quasi-compact (finitely
   many affine charts) and quasi-separated (Tag 01KO, quasi-compact overlaps); `f_i` is locally
   of finite presentation chartwise.
10. The `e_a` agree on the overlaps `O_{ab,i} ×_{S_i} S` and glue, with their inverses, to an
    isomorphism `X ≅ X_i ×_{S_i} S` over `S`. No quasi-compactness or quasi-separatedness of
    any `S_i` or of `S` is used.
