/-- The coproduct of modifications of distinct integral components is an isomorphism
on a dense open of the reduced target.
Source: Stacks Project, Morphisms 0BAJ and the proof of Etale Cohomology 0A3Q.
(blueprint: `lem-weil-pbc-dense-open-component-modifications`)

Proof: Write Z i for the image of ι i. Remove every Z j with j different from i,
obtaining an open W i contained in Z i and containing its generic point. The image
in W i of the intersection of U i with the inverse image of W i is open in X.
Indeed, the restriction of ι i to W i is a surjective closed immersion into a
reduced scheme, hence an isomorphism: on affines its ideal has zero locus the whole
spectrum, and therefore lies in the nilradical, which is zero. Each resulting
open V i contains the generic point of Z i because U i is dense and the component
is irreducible. The V i are pairwise disjoint, and their union U is dense since
its closure contains every component's generic point. Over V i all other summands
have empty preimage, while the i-th summand map is an isomorphism by restriction
from U i and the preceding isomorphism for ι i. Isomorphism is local on the target,
so these inverses glue over U. For an empty family the component-cover hypothesis
forces X empty and the empty open is dense, with the empty-to-empty map an isomorphism.
