/-- Factoring through the categorical local image can be checked on a finite covering
family. No projectivity or presentability of the source object is assumed.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 00WL, the image subsheaf argument; the categorical finite-cover
argument uses AB5 through the directed-pullback detection lemma.
Proof: compose x with the cokernel of the local-image inclusion at W. If all its
restrictions actually lift locally, transitivity of covering sieves shows that x lifts
locally on W, so its image lies in the local image and this composite is zero. Now remove
the local-lifting assumptions one member of the finite cover at a time. For each member,
the local-image detection lemma applies to its restriction and the same composite.
Precomposition preserves all remaining local lifts. Finite induction removes every
assumption. The vanishing of the cokernel composite gives the desired factorization.
The empty covering is included: the initial step already has no lifting assumptions. -/
