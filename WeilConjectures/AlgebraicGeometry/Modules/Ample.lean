# Ample invertible modules and the Hilbert degree

An `𝒪_X`-module is *very ample* relative to `f : X ⟶ S` if it is the pullback of `𝒪(1)` along
a closed immersion of `X` into a projective space `ℙ(n; S)` over `S`; it is then invertible. An
invertible module on a `K`-scheme is *ample* if some positive tensor power of it is very ample.
For an ample invertible module `M` on a proper `K`-scheme `X` of dimension `g`, the function
`m ↦ χ(X, M^{⊗ m})` is a numerical polynomial of degree at most `g`, and the *degree of `X` with
respect to `M`* is `g!` times its leading coefficient.

`AlgebraicGeometry.IsVeryAmple` and `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAmple` are genuine definitions, built
on the twisting sheaf `AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveSpace.twist`. The Euler characteristic of a
coherent sheaf is not available in Mathlib, however, so `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.degree`
is declared here as an `opaque` constant. Being `opaque` rather than `sorry`-bodied it depends
genuinely on its arguments and introduces no `sorryAx`; but it satisfies no equations
whatsoever, so **none of the statements below about the degree can be proved before it is
replaced**.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsVeryAmple`, `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAmple`: very ample and ample modules.
  These are real definitions.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.degree`: the degree of a proper scheme with respect to an ample
  invertible module (placeholder).

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsVeryAmple.isInvertible`: a very ample module is invertible.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.degree_pos_of_isAmple`: an ample invertible module on a proper
  curve has positive degree.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.degree_pullback`: the degree multiplies by the degree of the
  morphism under pullback along a finite surjective morphism.

/-- Blueprint `sk-def-av-ample-degree`: Ample modules and the Hilbert degree.

An `𝒪_X`-module `M` is *very ample* relative to `f : X ⟶ S` if there is a closed immersion
`i : X ⟶ ℙ(n; S)` over `S`, into a projective space with finitely many homogeneous
coordinates, with `i^* 𝒪(1) ≅ M`.

This is the "projective" variant of the notion: Hartshorne (II.5) and EGA II (4.4.2) only ask
for an immersion. The two agree when `f` is proper, since an immersion from a proper
`S`-scheme into the separated `S`-scheme `ℙ(n; S)` is closed, and every use of very ample
modules in the project is for a proper `f`. -/

The degree of a proper `K`-scheme `X` of dimension `g` with respect to an ample invertible
`𝒪_X`-module `M`: `g!` times the leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial
`m ↦ χ(X, M^{⊗ m})`.

Let `g : X ⟶ Y` be a finite surjective morphism of proper `K`-varieties of the same dimension,
let `M` be an ample invertible `𝒪_Y`-module and let `d = [k(X) : k(Y)]` be the degree of `g`.
Then `deg_{g^*M}(X) = d * deg_M(Y)`.
