# Coherent modules on a scheme

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.isCoherent`: coherent `𝒪_X`-modules, as a property of objects.

## Implementation notes

Mathlib has no `IsCoherent` class for sheaves of modules; as elsewhere in the project, coherence
is spelled as quasi-coherence together with finite presentation.

This agrees with coherence in the sense of Stacks `01BV` (finite type, and every finite type
submodule over an open is of finite presentation) only on locally noetherian schemes
(Stacks `01XZ`). On a general scheme it is weaker: `𝒪_X` is always quasi-coherent of finite
presentation, but it is coherent only if `X` is locally coherent, which fails for instance for
`Spec k[x₁, x₂, …]/(x₁x₂, x₁x₃, …)`. Results about `isCoherent` that need the Stacks notion
must therefore assume `X` locally noetherian.

This is coherence in the sense of Stacks `01BV` only when `X` is locally noetherian; on a general
scheme it is the weaker notion "quasi-coherent of finite presentation" (see the implementation
