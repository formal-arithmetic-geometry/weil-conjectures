/-- Residue-field evaluations detect a morphism between finite free sheaves on a reduced scheme.

Source: `thm-pc-semicontinuity-base-change`, proof (3), larger minors vanish on a reduced base.
(blueprint: lem-pc-free-map-residue-detection)

Proof: Each matrix entry has zero evaluation at every point, so its basic open is empty.
On a reduced scheme a section with empty basic open is zero: locally on an affine open it
lies in every prime ideal, hence is nilpotent, hence zero; sheaf separation glues this equality.
Thus all matrix entries vanish. A map from the structure sheaf is determined by its value on
1 in global sections. Consequently each inclusion followed by the map and a coordinate
projection is zero. The sum of the coordinate projection/inclusion pairs is the identity,
so the map kills every free generator and is zero by the coproduct universal property.
This also covers empty schemes and empty index types. -/
