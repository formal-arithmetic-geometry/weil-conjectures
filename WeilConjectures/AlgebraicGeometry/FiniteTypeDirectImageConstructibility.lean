# Bounded constructibility of finite-type direct images

The ordinary derived direct image preserves bounded constructibility, without a
separatedness hypothesis on the morphism.

/-- Direct image for a morphism of finite-type schemes over a field preserves bounded
constructible complexes with finite allowable commutative coefficients.

Proof:
1. Finite-type schemes over a field are Noetherian, using
`lem-wf-affine-noetherian-components` and finite affine covers. Choose a bounded-below
injective representative using `lem-weil-pbc-module-sheaves-enough-injectives` and
`lem-weil-pbc-dplus-injective-representative`. Open restriction is exact and preserves
injectives by `lem-pur-kinjective-restrict-localized-adjunction`. The section formula for
`def-weil-pbc-direct-image` identifies restricted direct images. Thus the assertion is
local on the target, and a finite affine cover glues constructibility and bounds.
2. Assume the target affine and choose a finite affine cover of the source. Each cover
member has the projective compactification of `prop-nagata-affine-compactification`,
`def-nagata-affine-compactification` and `def-nagata-compactification`. Every nonempty
intersection is open in such a compactification; it need not be affine. Apply
`cor-fin-deligne-open-finite-coefficients`, `lem-fin-proper-bounded-constructible` and
clause (5) of `lem-weil-derived-direct-image-composition` to obtain bounded constructible
intersection direct images. Empty intersections give zero.
3. Apply the finite alternating Cech resolution to the injective representative.
Insertion of a cover index contracts each augmented row locally. Restriction preserves
injectives and open direct image preserves them by its exact left adjoint. Finite sums preserve injectivity. Splitting successive
monomorphisms makes each augmented row split exact, hence exact after direct image.
The total augmentation is a quasi-isomorphism: eliminate successive lowest vertical
components using horizontal exactness, terminating in the finite horizontal range.
Shift the bounded-below vertical index to use `def-sp-double-complex-total` and reindex
back, retaining the differential d_h + (-1)^p d_v.
4. Filter the total complex by horizontal degree and apply
`lem-sp-bounded-filtered-page-core`. Quotient maps come from filtration inclusions.
Its first page is the finite sum of intersection direct-image cohomology; its finite
abutment filtration computes the original direct image. Column signs do not change
kernels or images. No composite-functor spectral sequence is used.
5. Take the minimum and maximum of the finitely many intersection bounds. The first
page lies in a finite rectangle. By `thm-constructible-serre`, finite sums, kernels,
cokernels and extensions preserve constructibility; induction gives constructible
stable pages and abutments. The finite filtration gives vanishing outside the total
rectangle. This is `def-weil-pbc-constructible-complexes`. A single cover member gives
one column, zero complexes give zero pages, and the empty source is immediate.
Finally glue over the finite target cover from step 1. -/
