/-- For a proper morphism and a torsion commutative coefficient ring, the canonical
projection-formula map is invertible on arbitrary unbounded complexes.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0F0G, `lemma-projection-formula-proper-mod-n`.

Proof plan:
1. Base change to a geometric point of Y. The geometric fibre is proper over an
   algebraically closed field, hence finite type and qcqs. Clause (2) of lem-kun-0f10
   gives finite torsion cohomological dimension on this fibre. No global bound on Y
   is asserted.
2. Identify inverse image to the point with the stalk.
   The Galois group of an algebraically closed field is trivial, so the equivalence
   of lem-exc-abelian-sheaves-gmodules identifies module sheaves on the point with
   modules, and their unbounded derived categories likewise. The pulled-back K is
   therefore a constant complex on the fibre.
3. Apply lem-kun-proper-base-change-torsion-ring to E and to the tensor with inverse
   image of K. Both exchange maps are invertible without boundedness assumptions.
   Monoidality and the commuting square of
   lem-kun-proj-formula-natural identify the stalk of the canonical projection map
   with the canonical projection map on the fibre, not just its endpoints.
4. The constant-complex formula lem-kun-0f12 on the qcqs fibre of finite dimension
   makes this map invertible. Its adjoint description is exactly
   def-kun-projection-formula-map.
5. Exact geometric stalks identify homology
   of the stalk map with stalks of its homology maps. Forgetting the coefficient
   action preserves kernels and cokernels. Conservativity makes every homology map invertible;
   the cone is acyclic, so the original map is invertible. No bound on E or K is used. -/
