# Proper direct image of unbounded complexes: statement

The theorem states the three assertions for both coefficient choices in the current
condensed model.  The two existing predicates expand the degreewise ind-constructible
condition, the two amplitude bounds, the canonical finite truncation window, and the
canonical arbitrary-direct-sum comparison.

/-- Proper direct image of unbounded ind-constructible complexes, with its finite
cohomological window and arbitrary direct sums, for both `E` and `ℚ̄_ℓ` coefficients.

Proof plan, the eight steps of the DAG node:
1. Ambient setting: Dic and IndCons as in sk-cor-ambient-ind-derived and sk-prop-ind-heart.
   The module categories are Grothendieck, so
   lem-sfb-grothendieck-k-injective gives K-injective resolutions, and
   lem-pc-right-derived-functor-triangulated makes Rp_*
   exact and shift-compatible.
2. Bounded-below K: the spectral sequence of thm-sp-truncation-e2,
   E_2^{u,v} = R^u p_* H^v(K) => H^{u+v}(Rp_*K), has columns 0 <= u <= 2d+1 with
   ind-constructible terms by sk-lem-proper-heart-bound. Closure of IndCons under kernels,
   cokernels and extensions (sk-prop-ind-heart (2)) and the finite filtration give
   IndCons membership and both amplitude bounds.
3. Arbitrary K: sk-prop-pe-left-complete gives K = Rlim_n A_n, A_n = tau_ge(-n) K. Rp_* is a
   right adjoint, so it preserves products, and lem-pc-homotopy-limit-map gives
   Rp_*K = Rlim_n Rp_*A_n with the images of the canonical projections.
4. The fibre of A_(n+1) -> A_n is H^(-n-1)(K)[n+1], whose image lies in degrees
   [-n-1, 2d-n]. For fixed q the towers H^q and H^(q-1) of Rp_*A_n are eventually constant,
   so lim^1 = 0 and H^q(Rp_*K) = H^q(Rp_*A_n) for large n. Step 2 then
   gives (1).
5. The triangles tau_le q K -> K -> tau_ge (q+1) K and tau_le (q-2d-2) K -> tau_le q K -> W_q K,
   W_q = tau_ge(q-2d-1) tau_le q, with the bounds of (1)
   and lem-sf-derived-homology-long-exact, make both canonical arrows on H^q Rp_* invertible.
   Inverse of the first followed by the second is (6.5) in IndCons. This proves (2).
6. Sums: exact small sums in the Grothendieck categories; lem-kun-grothendieck-derived-coproducts,
   src-weil-derived-homology-preserves-coproducts and lem-sfb-derived-truncation-coproducts
   make cohomology and truncations commute with sums; sums of triangles are distinguished.
7. Families in a common finite interval [r,s]: induct on s-r. The single-degree case is the
   arbitrary-sum clause of sk-lem-proper-heart-bound with
   lem-weil-pbc-unbounded-derived-iso-cohomology; the induction uses the top-cohomology
   triangles and lem-sf-triangle-morphism-iso.
8. Arbitrary families: for each q the natural window isomorphisms of step 5 and step 6 identify
   H^q of the comparison with the comparison for W_q K_alpha in [q-2d-1,q], invertible by
   step 7. By lem-weil-pbc-unbounded-derived-iso-cohomology the comparison is invertible.
   This proves (3). -/
