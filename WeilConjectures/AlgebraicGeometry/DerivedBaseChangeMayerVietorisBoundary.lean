/-- Distinguished cover triangles and the connecting square for the constructed
canonical comparison maps. The open adjunctions are fixed explicit constructions.
This asserts no first or second square and constructs no triangle morphism.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 08BV, 08HZ and 0DJ9, induction step
(blueprint: lem-pc-rf-mv-base-change-connecting-square).
Proof:
1. An affine-to-affine morphism g is affine, and so is g'. The base changes
   f' and g' are qcqs. The qcqs sources X and X' and the inverse-image cover
   satisfy the compactness hypotheses, including the overlap. Transpose ψ
   under the pinned Lg'^* / Rg'_* adjunction; Rg'_*K' has quasi-coherent
   cohomology by schemeDerivedDirectImage_preserves_QCoh.
2. Choose K-injective representatives with injective terms for K and K'. Use
   schemeKInjective_mayerVietoris_presentation with the explicit adjunctions
   mvOpenRestrictionAdjunction. For each W, the resulting complex is the
   direct image of the restriction of the representative. Its two maps are
   exactly the units and the difference of adjoint restrictions in this
   statement. Apply triangleOfSES to obtain δ and δ' and distinguishedness.
3. Represent the transposed ψ by a chain map into a K-injective representative
   of g'_* of the second representative. Restrict this one chain map to U,
   V and their overlap. Together with the resolution comparison it gives a
   morphism of short exact Mayer--Vietoris sequences. The connecting maps
   commute by naturality of triangleOfSES. This uses a morphism of sequences,
   rather than inferring a connecting square from two squares in a triangulated
   category. The degreewise split presentation of the direct-image sequence
   identifies its boundary with Rg'_*δ', as in the direct-image part of
   schemeDerived_mayerVietoris_directImage.
4. Identify all direct-image compositions by the right-adjoint mates of the
   pinned pullback composition comparisons, not by independently selected
   bare isomorphisms. The unit/counit equations of mvOpenPullbackIso and
   associativity of those comparisons identify the restricted chain maps
   with the transposes of mvBaseChangeOpenMap. Apply Rf_* and transpose the
   full connecting equation under Lg^* / Rg_*. Naturality of the Hom equivalence
   and its shift compatibility give precisely the final displayed equation.
5. Derived pullback admits a triangulated shift structure by
   exists_derivedPullback. Derived direct image is a triangulated right derived
   functor. Compose these structures to obtain csF and csG; their mapTriangle
   functors send the two distinguished triangles to distinguished triangles.
   Empty opens, the zero object and redundant covers use the same sequences. -/
