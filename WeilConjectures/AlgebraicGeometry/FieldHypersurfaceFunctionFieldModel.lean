/-- A geometrically integral affine scheme of finite type over a field has the function
field of a geometrically integral hypersurface over that field.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0559, first proof, paragraphs beginning with the generic
point and the separating generators.
Proof: The affine section algebra is a finitely generated geometrically integral
K-algebra, so its fraction field L is finitely generated and separably generated over K.
Choose a separating transcendence basis and a primitive element for the remaining finite
separable extension. Take the primitive numerator Q of its minimal polynomial. Gauss's
lemma identifies the quotient with a subalgebra of L having fraction field L. After any
field extension, the same injection into the localization of the geometrically integral
section algebra shows that the quotient is still a domain. Its spectrum is therefore
geometrically irreducible and reduced, and both schemes are integral. A finite polynomial
algebra and its principal quotient are finitely presented, giving local finite type.
The two inclusions in L induce the fraction-ring equivalence, and both fix K; composing
with the canonical global-section identification of Spec K gives the displayed equality.
When L is purely transcendental use one extra variable with equation T; this includes L=K. -/
