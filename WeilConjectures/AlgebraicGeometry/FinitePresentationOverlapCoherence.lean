/-- The specific lifted natural overlap maps become coherent at a later stage.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01ZR, first proof, Zariski gluing, and Tag 05N7,
eventual equality of maps.

Proof: The comparison with M makes the diagonal and triple cocycle equations
true after pullback to the limit. Test the diagonal equation on each member of
the finite cover. Test the cocycle on the threefold fiber product of each triple
of cover members. Each test scheme is quasi-compact and quasi-separated, because
it is an intersection of finitely many quasi-compact opens in a quasi-separated
scheme. Choose finite affine covers of these test schemes. The tested sources
and targets are restrictions of the prescribed finitely presented quasi-coherent
models. On each affine chart, use the equality clause of 05N7 to make the two
maps equal at a later stage. A common upper bound of these finitely many stages
makes every equation hold. Sheaf locality gives the equations on the whole test
schemes. Pullback naturality and the universal properties of the diagonal and
threefold fiber products give the equations on all test schemes. The transitions
at this later stage are the canonical pullbacks of the supplied T, not newly
chosen maps. The chart refinement map is the displayed pullback lift, so its
composition with the original chart projection is the original projection at
the later stage. Transport the supplied limit comparison through these
composition isomorphisms. Naturality of the composition isomorphisms preserves
its commutation equation. Empty covers have vacuous equations. For a preorder
use the partial-order quotient of the nonempty tail above the supplied stage.
This uses only eventual equality; no overlap map is lifted in this step. -/
