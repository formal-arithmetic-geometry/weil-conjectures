/-- The coordinatewise tensor map exists, before checking its monad laws.
Source: Banerjee, arXiv:1004.1491, §1.1.4, pp. 15–16; Stacks, Tag 0FKR.
Proof: For two stalk elements choose representatives on a common neighbourhood and take the
stalk germ of their sectionwise tensor under `moduleCup_sectionTensor`. Restriction
compatibility makes this independent of representatives: intersect neighbourhoods on which
representatives agree, and use functoriality of the presheaf tensor and sheafification unit.
It is bilinear over the stalk ring by representing each scalar on a common neighbourhood.
For every point x, evaluate the two projections to its skyscrapers and apply this bilinear
map. On an open containing x these operations are bilinear over the ring of sections via the
ring germ, and on an open not containing x the skyscraper sections are zero. Thus tensor
universality gives a map of presheaves to that skyscraper. Sheafification adjunction extends
it uniquely to the sheaf tensor product. Product universality assembles these maps into b;
the construction gives exactly the two coordinate formulas. For an empty scheme this is the
unique map into the empty product. Zero inputs give the zero map by bilinearity. -/
