/-- A morphism `f : X ⟶ S` is *H-projective* (or *relatively projective*) if it factors as a
closed immersion `i : X ⟶ ℙ(n; S)` into a projective space over `S`, for some finite type of
homogeneous coordinates `n`, followed by the structure morphism of `ℙ(n; S)`.

/-- A morphism `f : X ⟶ S` is *projective* if it is H-projective and quasi-compact. A scheme over
a field `k` is projective over `k` if its structure morphism is projective.

`AlgebraicGeometry.IsProjective.toIsHProjective` it would form an instance cycle. -/
