/-- Base change of the diagonal over the original base detects separatedness of the
base-changed morphism.

Source: Stacks Project, Limits, Tag 01ZQ, the diagonal base-change identification in the
proof; equivalently the universal property of fibre products.
(blueprint: `lem-weil-pbc-over-pullback-diagonal-closed-immersion`).

Proof: Write X' = X ×_S T and Y' = Y ×_S T. The universal properties of the fibre products
identify (X ×_Y X) ×_S T with X' ×_{Y'} X': the two components are the base-changed
projections to X, with their common component to T. Conversely the two projections from
X' ×_{Y'} X' have equal components to T and give the inverse map. Checking both
projections proves that these maps are inverse. Under this isomorphism the base change
of Δ_f becomes Δ_{f'}, since both of its projections to X' are the identity. A closed
immersion is invariant under composition with an isomorphism, and IsSeparated f' means
exactly that Δ_{f'} is a closed immersion. This proves both implications. No compactness
or finiteness hypothesis is used; the argument also applies to empty schemes. -/
