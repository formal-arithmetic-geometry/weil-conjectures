# Weakly étale universal homeomorphisms

We show that a morphism between weakly étale `S`-schemes is weakly étale, and that a weakly
étale universal homeomorphism is an isomorphism. The latter is the key input showing that the
absolute Frobenius acts trivially on the small pro-étale site.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeaklyEtale.of_comp_eq`: an `S`-morphism between weakly étale `S`-schemes
  is weakly étale.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeaklyEtale.isIso_of_isUniversalHomeomorphism`: a weakly étale universal
  homeomorphism is an isomorphism.
