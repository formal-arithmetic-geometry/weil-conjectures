# Universal homeomorphisms of schemes

A morphism of schemes is a *universal homeomorphism* if every base change of it is a
homeomorphism on underlying topological spaces. By [Stacks 04DF] this holds if and only if
the morphism is integral, universally injective and surjective, and this is the definition
we take: all three are readily available as classes, while quantifying over all base
changes is not.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsUniversalHomeomorphism`: the class of universal homeomorphisms.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsUniversalHomeomorphism.homeomorph`: the homeomorphism of underlying
  topological spaces induced by a universal homeomorphism.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.isUniversalHomeomorphism_eq`: the `MorphismProperty` description of
  the class as the infimum of being integral, universally injective and surjective.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.isHomeomorph`: a universal homeomorphism is in particular a
  homeomorphism on underlying spaces.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsUniversalHomeomorphism.of_comp`: if `g ≫ f` and `f` are universal
  homeomorphisms, then so is `g`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.isUniversalHomeomorphism_le_universally_isHomeomorph`: a universal
  homeomorphism stays a homeomorphism after an arbitrary base change. This is the direction
  of [Stacks 04DF] that the definition does not make trivial; the converse, that a morphism
  all of whose base changes are homeomorphisms is integral, is not formalised here.

## Implementation notes

The stability properties (composition, base change, isomorphisms) are all proved by
rewriting along `AlgebraicGeometry.isUniversalHomeomorphism_eq` and appealing to the
corresponding properties of the three defining classes.
