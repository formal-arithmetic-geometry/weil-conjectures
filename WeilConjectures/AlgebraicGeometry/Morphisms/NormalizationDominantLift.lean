/-- A dominant map from a normal integral scheme has a unique dominant lift to normalization.

(blueprint: lem-sbc-normalization-dominant-lift)

Proof: Dominance sends the generic point of Y to that of Z. Stalk-map naturality
therefore gives m:Spec K(Y) -> Spec K(Z) over g. Let a be m followed by the canonical
map Spec K(Z) -> Z.normalization. The absolute normalization of Y is Y, because its
stalks are integrally closed: apply the normalization-over-normal-locus theorem at
the top open. Lift (a,jY) to the pullback of Z.fromNormalization along g, whose
projection to Y is integral. The universal property of relative normalization applied
to jY gives a map Y.normalization to this pullback. Precompose with the inverse of
Y.fromNormalization and take its first projection. The normalization equations give
f;Z.fromNormalization=g and jY;f=a. Maps of field spectra are dominant, so a and f
are dominant. For another dominant lift, its generic restriction factors through the
generic point of Z.normalization. The existing generic-field isomorphism identifies
this point with Spec K(Z). Postcomposition into Z agrees for both lifts, and the
generic-point inclusion Spec K(Z) -> Z is a monomorphism, so the generic restrictions
agree. The integral morphism Z.fromNormalization is separated. The dominant jY is
scheme-theoretically dominant since Y is reduced, so separated-target rigidity proves
the lifts equal. No compactness, Noetherian, or finite-type hypothesis is used. -/
