# Flatness near a point from a flat test

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0EYJ, flatness descent and openness.

This module proves only the descent step, after flatness of the test pullback
has been established. In the normalization application, the rational generic
section point is essential to establish that flatness: it is the hypothesis
`hZ` of `GaloisCover.stalk_normalization_depth_two_section_flat` and
`GaloisCover.exists_stalk_normalization_split_formal_test`.
Depth two alone does not establish the flat-pullback hypothesis here.

/-- A finite morphism is flat over a neighbourhood of x if a flat test through x
makes its pullback flat. This isolates descent and openness from the formal
splitting calculation. The assumption `Flat (pullback.snd p t)` is an input,
not a consequence of depth two. For the normalization application, the rational
point over the generic section is used upstream to split this pullback.
