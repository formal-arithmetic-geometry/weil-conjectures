/-! # Canonical transition maps for higher direct images

These are the unchanged definitions moved from the source Transition module to
allow its continuity proof to import independent coherence and affine-continuity lemmas.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 09Z1 and Tag 03Q8.

/-! The transition map `Rh_* K ⟶ Rh'_* (a^* K)` attached to a commutative triangle
`a ≫ h = h'`: the unit of `Lh'^* ⊣ Rh'_*` at `Rh_* K`, followed by `Rh'_*` applied to the
composition isomorphism `Lh'^* ≅ Lh^* ⋙ La^*` and to `La^*` of the counit of
`Lh^* ⊣ Rh_*` at `K`. -/
/-! The transition map `R^q h_* F ⟶ R^q h'_* a^* F` of higher direct images attached to a
commutative triangle `a ≫ h = h'`: the degree-`q` homology of
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.lowerStarPlusTransition` at `F` placed in degree `0`, followed by the
identification `a^*(F[0]) ≅ (a^* F)[0]`. -/
/-! The transition map of higher direct images along a morphism `φ : U ⟶ V` of schemes over
`W`, for the sheaves pulled back from a fixed sheaf `G` on `W` and the structure morphisms
composed with `k : W ⟶ S`:
`R^q (V → S)_* (G|_V) ⟶ R^q (U → S)_* (G|_U)`. It is
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.higherDirectImageTransition` followed by the identification
`φ^*(G|_V) ≅ G|_U`. -/
