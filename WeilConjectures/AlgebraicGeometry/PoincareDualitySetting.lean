# The fixed geometric setting of the Poincaré duality chapter

Poincaré duality for `ℓ`-adic cohomology is stated for a scheme `X₀` over a finite field `k₀`
which is smooth of relative dimension `d`, separated of finite type and geometrically
connected, base changed to an algebraic closure `k` of `k₀`. This file packages that
geometric datum as a single structure, so that the statements of the chapter can quantify
over it.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.PoincareDualitySetting`: the geometric datum `(X₀, a_{X₀})`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.PoincareDualitySetting.geometricFiber`: the base change
  `X = X₀ ×_{k₀} k` to the algebraic closure.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.PoincareDualitySetting.structureMorphism`: the structure morphism
  `a_X : X ⟶ Spec k`.

## Implementation notes

Properness of `X₀` is deliberately *not* part of the datum: the duality statements are
formulated with compact supports and do not use it. It is imposed explicitly, as an
`[IsProper …]` instance hypothesis, exactly where `Ra_{X!} ≅ Ra_{X*}` is needed.

The blueprint (`sk-def-set`) imposes no admissibility on `a_X`. In Lean, `Ra_{X!}` and
`Ra_X^!` are only constructed for morphisms admitting a compactification, so
`AlgebraicGeometry.HasCompactification` is carried as an instance hypothesis by the statements
that use them rather than as a field of the datum. For `a_X` this hypothesis is redundant
mathematically: `a_X` is separated of finite type over the quasi-compact quasi-separated
`Spec k`, so Nagata's theorem (`AlgebraicGeometry.NagataCompactification`, which comes with an
instance) provides a compactification once those properties of `a_X` are available as
instances.

The blueprint node `sk-def-set` fixes, besides the geometry, a *coefficient* datum
`(ℓ, E, 𝒪_E, ϖ_E, Λ)` subject to `ℓ ≠ ring characteristic of k₀`. That half of the datum is
not recorded here: the coefficient category is a type parameter of the six operations, and
the constraint `ℓ ≠ p` is a hypothesis of the duality *theorems*, none of which is stated
yet. It is to be added together with them.

Likewise the Frobenius endomorphism of the geometric fibre is not constructed here; it is the
geometric Galois Frobenius `𝟙_{X₀} × Spec σ` of
`WeilConjectures.AlgebraicGeometry.GeometricFrobenius`, where `σ` is the geometric — not the
arithmetic — Frobenius of the algebraic closure.

/-- Blueprint `sk-def-set`: The fixed setting.

The geometric datum of the Poincaré duality chapter over the finite field `k₀`: a scheme `X₀`
over `k₀` which is smooth of relative dimension `d`, separated of finite type and
geometrically connected. The algebraic closure `k` of `k₀`, along which `X₀` is base changed,
is an argument of `PoincareDualitySetting.geometricFiber` rather than a field of the
datum. -/

That `k` is an algebraic closure of `k₀`, and not just an algebraically closed extension, is the
hypothesis `[Algebra.IsAlgebraic k₀ k]`: without it the `k`-points of `X` would not be the
`𝔽̄_q`-points of `X₀`. With it `k ≅ AlgebraicClosure k₀` over `k₀` (`IsAlgClosure`), so this is
the geometric fiber `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.geometricFiber` of `S.modelStructureMorphism`

`WeilConjectures.AlgebraicGeometry.GeometricFrobenius`, up to the choice of the algebraic
