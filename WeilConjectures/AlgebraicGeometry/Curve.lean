# Curves, their genus, and the Picard group of a curve

A *curve* over a field `K` is a separated scheme of finite type over `K` whose underlying space
has Krull dimension at most one. "Of finite type" is spelled as `LocallyOfFiniteType` together
with `QuasiCompact`, Mathlib having no bundled class for the conjunction. For a smooth proper
connected curve `C` over `K` the *genus* is `g = dim_K H⁰(C, Ω¹_{C/K})`, the dimension of the
space of global differential forms.

The Picard group `Pic(C)` of isomorphism classes of invertible `𝒪_C`-modules is
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Pic`, introduced in
`WeilConjectures.AlgebraicGeometry.PicardFunctor`; on a curve it carries a *degree* map to `ℤ`,
whose kernel `Pic⁰(C)` is the subject of the Jacobian.

The sheaf `Ω¹_{C/K}` is `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.relativeDifferentials`, from
`WeilConjectures.AlgebraicGeometry.Modules.Differentials`. The degree of an invertible module
`L` is defined cohomologically, as `deg L = χ(L) - χ(𝒪_C)` (Stacks 0AYQ), through
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.degree`.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsCurve`: a separated morphism of finite type to `Spec K` whose source has
  topological Krull dimension at most one.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsConnectedCurve`: a curve whose source is connected, hence nonempty, and
  of topological Krull dimension exactly one.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.relativeDifferentials`: the sheaf `Ω¹_{X/S}` of relative
  differentials (see `WeilConjectures.AlgebraicGeometry.Modules.Differentials`).
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.genus`: the genus `dim_K Γ(C, Ω¹_{C/K})` of a curve.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.picDegree`: the degree `χ(L) - χ(𝒪_C)` of an invertible module
  on a curve.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.picZero`: the degree-zero part `Pic⁰(C)` of the Picard group.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.genus_eq_finrankH_zero`: the genus is `h⁰(C, Ω¹_{C/K})`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.picDegree_mk`: the degree of the class of an invertible module
  `M` is `χ(M) - χ(𝒪_C)`.

The degree as a group homomorphism, and its identification with the degree of divisors over an
algebraically closed field, are in `WeilConjectures/AlgebraicGeometry/Curve/Picard.lean`.

/-- Blueprint `sk-def-curve`: Curves and genus

Let `K` be a field (in the blueprint, algebraically closed). A *curve* over `K` is a separated
scheme of finite type over `K` of dimension at most one. Smoothness and properness of a curve
are the corresponding properties `Smooth` and `IsProper` of its structure morphism, so they are
not part of this class; the dimension condition is phrased with `topologicalKrullDim`, which is
valued in `WithBot ℕ∞` and is `⊥` exactly on the empty scheme. -/
class IsCurve (f : C ⟶ Spec (.of K)) : Prop
    extends IsSeparated f, LocallyOfFiniteType f, QuasiCompact f where
  /-- The underlying space of a curve has dimension at most one. -/
  krullDim_le_one : topologicalKrullDim C ≤ 1

/-- Blueprint `sk-def-curve`: Curves and genus

A *connected curve* over `K` is a curve over `K` that is connected (hence nonempty) and of
dimension exactly one. The last condition excludes points such as `Spec K`, for which the curve
estimate `sk-thm-curveestimate` fails in degree two. It also implies nonemptiness on its own,
since `topologicalKrullDim` is `⊥` exactly on the empty space.

The field `IsConnectedCurve.connectedSpace` is not an instance, since `f` cannot be inferred
from `ConnectedSpace C`; use `have := IsConnectedCurve.connectedSpace' f`. -/

/-- Blueprint `sk-def-curve`: Curves and genus

The *genus* of a smooth proper connected curve `C` over `K` is
`g = dim_K H⁰(C, Ω¹_{C/K})`, the `K`-dimension of the space of global sections of the sheaf of
relative differentials. Since `C` is proper the global sections form a finite-dimensional
`K`-vector space; the `K`-module structure on `Γ(Ω¹_{C/K}, ⊤)` comes from the `Γ(C, ⊤)`-module
structure by restriction of scalars along the `K`-algebra structure of `Γ(C, ⊤)`.

This definition makes sense for an arbitrary morphism `f : C ⟶ Spec K`, but is only the genus
in the intended sense when `f` is a smooth proper connected curve.

For a smooth proper curve, Serre duality identifies this with the arithmetic genus
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.arithmeticGenus K C = dim_K H¹(C, 𝒪_C)`; see
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.genus_eq_arithmeticGenus`. -/

  letI := f.ΓAlgebra
  letI : Module K Γ(f.relativeDifferentials, ⊤) := Module.compHom _ (algebraMap K Γ(C, ⊤))
  Module.finrank K Γ(f.relativeDifferentials, ⊤)

/-- The genus `dim_K Γ(C, Ω¹_{C/K})` is `h⁰(C, Ω¹_{C/K})`: the global sections of a sheaf of
modules are its cohomology in degree `0`, compatibly with the `K`-module structures. -/

/-- Blueprint `sk-def-av-pic`: Pic, degree, Pic⁰

The degree `deg L = χ(L) - χ(𝒪_C)` of the class `L` of an invertible module on a curve `C`
over `K` (Stacks 0AYQ), where `χ` is the Euler characteristic
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.eulerChar` over `K`; this is
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.degree` of a representative of `L`.

On a smooth projective geometrically integral curve this is the degree of any associated Weil
divisor, and the Riemann-Roch formula `χ(L) = deg L + 1 - g` holds. -/

/-- Blueprint `sk-def-av-pic`: Pic, degree, Pic⁰

Let `C` be a smooth projective geometrically integral curve over a field `K`. Its Picard group
`Pic(C) = H¹(C_ét, 𝔾ₘ)` is the group of invertible `𝒪_C`-modules up to isomorphism; it is
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Pic`. The degree homomorphism `deg : Pic(C) → ℤ` is
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.picDegree`, and `Pic⁰(C) := ker(deg)` is the subgroup of classes
of degree zero, recorded here as the subset `f.picZero` of `C.Pic`.

For a smooth proper curve the degree is the group homomorphism
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.picDegreeHom`, whose kernel is `picZero`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.coe_ker_picDegreeHom`). -/
