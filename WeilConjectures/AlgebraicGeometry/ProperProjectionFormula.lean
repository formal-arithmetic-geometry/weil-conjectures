# The proper projection formula with the base factor first

Source:; Stacks Project, Tag 0F0G, and Tag 06YU.

The map is the specified composite of the canonical signed derived symmetry, the
adjoint-of-counit projection map, and direct image of the signed symmetry on the source.
The derived inverse image is the exact termwise inverse image through
`leftDerivedUpperStarIsoMapDerivedCategory`; no boundedness condition is imposed.

/-- The proper projection formula for ordinary unbounded small-etale module complexes, with
finite commutative coefficients and the tensor factors ordered as in the blueprint.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0F0G and the signed symmetry following Tag 06YU.

Proof:
1. Apply the existing finite-coefficient proper projection theorem
   `isIso_rightDerivedLowerStarProjectionMap_of_finite` to `A` and `r`. Its geometric-stalk
   proof identifies the canonical map with the constant-complex projection map on each
   proper geometric fibre, then uses geometric-stalk conservativity. The theorem is
   unbounded and has no Tor-amplitude hypothesis.
2. Take the component at `L`, then at `K`, to obtain invertibility of the middle map.
3. The two displayed symmetries are components of `derivedTensorSymmetry`, hence
   isomorphisms. Direct image preserves the second isomorphism. Composition of these
   three isomorphisms proves the assertion for the specified reordered map. -/
