/-- An integral Noetherian separated curve has an ample invertible module.
Source: Stacks Project, Varieties, Lemma 09ND.

Proof:
1. Choose a finite cover by nonempty affine opens; each complement is finite
   by `IsOpen.finite_compl_of_topologicalKrullDim_le_one`.
2. Apply `lem-sc-find-globally-generated` to each affine open and its finite
   complement, obtaining a globally generated invertible module and a section
   with affine principal open equal to that open. The complement points have
   Noetherian local rings of dimension one: they are not the generic point of
   the integral curve, and their local dimensions are at most `dim Y = 1`.
3. The ample criterion `lem-sc-enough-globally-generated-ample` applied to
   these principal opens gives an ample invertible module.
