/-- Descend the conjugated transition on one pairwise overlap, with persistence at later stages.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01ZR, first proof (Zariski gluing), and Tag 05N7 (2), (3).

Proof: The overlap of the two fixed affine charts is quasi-compact because the ambient
scheme is quasi-separated. Cover it by finitely many affine opens, and cover their
pairwise intersections by finitely many affine opens. The restrictions of N a and N b
are finitely presented and quasi-coherent. Conjugate the restriction map of M by e a
and e b. On each affine chart, the limit ring is the directed colimit of the stage
rings and module pullback is extension of scalars. Apply Tag 05N7 (2) to lift the map
on each chart. Apply (3) on the finite refinement intersections to make the local
maps agree at a common later stage. Glue to a map on the entire pairwise overlap.
Its limit pullback is the prescribed map by construction and the sheaf condition.
Pull this map back to every subsequent stage. Pullback composition and the canonical
iterated comparisons give the displayed square there. This argument concerns just
one pair: it asserts neither a common stage for all pairs nor natural overlap
transitions on arbitrary test schemes. If the overlap is empty its unique map works.
For a preorder use the partial-order quotient of the nonempty tail above j. -/
