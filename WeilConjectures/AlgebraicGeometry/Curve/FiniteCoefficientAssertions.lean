/-! # The eight curve assertions for finite coefficients

The eight assertions `C(X, F)` hold for every sheaf of modules `F` over a finite coefficient
ring on every curve `X` over an algebraically closed field. This is the reduction
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsCurve.Assertions.of_forall_isReduced` applied to the prime-field case
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsCurve.primeCoefficientCurveAssertions`, which holds on every reduced curve.
In particular the assertions for `F` and for `j_! j^* F` are equivalent for every open `j`,
without any condition on the torsion of `F`.

/-- **The curve package.** Let `k` be algebraically closed, `X` a curve over `k` and `Λ` a
finite ring. Then the eight assertions `C(X, F)` hold for every sheaf `F` of `Λ`-modules on
`X_ét`; such a sheaf is torsion because `Λ` is finite.

/-- **Extension by zero from an open does not change the eight assertions**, for sheaves of
modules over a finite ring. Let `k` be algebraically closed, `X` a curve over `k`, `Λ` a
finite ring, `F` a sheaf of `Λ`-modules on `X_ét` and `j : U ⟶ X` an open immersion. Then
`C(X, F)` holds if and only if `C(X, j_! j^* F)` holds. No condition on the torsion of `F` is
needed, and the statement holds for every open `U`, in particular for every dense open.
