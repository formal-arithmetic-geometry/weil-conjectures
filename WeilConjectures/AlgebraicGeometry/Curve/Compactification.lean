# Smooth proper completion of a smooth curve over a finite field

A smooth geometrically connected curve `U₀` over a finite field `K = 𝔽_q` embeds as a dense
open subscheme of a curve `C₀` which is *proper* over `K` and still smooth and geometrically
connected, the boundary `C₀ \ U₀` being a finite set of closed points.

Separatedness of `U₀` over `K` is part of `AlgebraicGeometry.IsCurve` and is necessary: a
compactification of `p` forces `p` to be separated
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.isSeparated`), so the affine line with doubled origin has
none.

The proof works over any perfect field `K`. Nagata's compactification theorem embeds `U₀` as an
open subscheme of a scheme `Z` proper over `K`. Let `C₀` be the relative normalization of `Z` in
`U₀`, i.e. the normalization of `Z` in the function field of `U₀` restricted to `U₀`. Since
normalization commutes with the smooth base change `U₀ ⟶ Z`, the curve `U₀` is a dense open
subscheme of `C₀`; the morphism `C₀ ⟶ Z` is finite, so `C₀` is proper over `K`; it is integral of
dimension `dim U₀ = 1` and has integrally closed local rings because `U₀` has. Being normal of
dimension one, `C₀` is regular, hence smooth over the perfect field `K`. The boundary is the
complement of a nonempty open subset of an irreducible noetherian space of dimension one, hence
a finite set of closed points, and `C₀` is geometrically connected since it contains the
geometrically connected `U₀` as a dense open subscheme.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_smooth_properCompactification`: the smooth proper completion of a
  smooth geometrically connected curve over a finite field.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_smooth_properCompactification_of_perfectField`: the same over a
  perfect field, recording also that the completion is integral and `U₀` dense in it.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsCurve.exists_projectiveClosure`: an integral curve over a field is a dense
  open subscheme of an integral closed subscheme of projective space.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_smooth_projectiveCompactification`: a normal geometrically connected
  curve of pure dimension one over a perfect field is smooth and has a smooth projective
  geometrically connected completion with finite boundary.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsCurve.isQuasiProjective`: a smooth curve over a field is
  quasi-projective.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsConnectedCurve.exists_smooth_properCompactification`: a smooth connected
  curve over an algebraically closed field is a dense open subscheme of a smooth proper
  connected curve, with finite boundary.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsConnectedCurve.isAffine_of_ne_top`: a proper open subscheme of a smooth
  proper connected curve over an algebraically closed field is affine.

An integral curve `U` over a field `K` (separated, of finite type, of dimension at most one)
admits a locally closed immersion `j ≫ ι` into a projective space `ℙ(n; Spec K)` over `K`, where
`ι : X ⟶ ℙ(n; Spec K)` is a closed immersion of an integral scheme `X` and `j : U ⟶ X` is an open
immersion with dense image; thus `X` is the scheme-theoretic closure of `U` in `ℙ(n; Spec K)`.

Every smooth geometrically connected curve `U₀` over a finite field `K` admits a smooth proper
completion: a compactification `c : Compactification p` of the structure morphism
