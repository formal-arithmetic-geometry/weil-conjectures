/-- The canonical comparison on degree-zero Picard groups is injective and every
prime-to-characteristic torsion point after extension lifts to a torsion point before extension.

Source: blueprint sec-curve-estimates/sk-prop-ext-invariance, proper degree-one comparison
and affine Jacobian correction (blueprint: lem-sc-piczero-torsion-base-change).

Proof: a proper smooth connected curve over an algebraically closed field is geometrically
integral and smooth of relative dimension one. Jacobian representability identifies its
Picard degree-zero subgroup with the rational points of its Jacobian. Compatibility of the
representing Picard functor with base change identifies the specified pullback homomorphism
with extension of rational points of this same Jacobian. The latter is injective: two
morphisms from Spec k equal after Spec k' have the same image point and the same residue-field
map, since k to k' is injective. For torsion, n is positive and prime to the characteristic,
so clause (c) of the abelian-variety estimate makes extension bijective on the rational
points of the finite etale n-torsion subgroup scheme. Identify those points with the elements
whose nth power is one, and transport through the natural Jacobian identifications. The
hypotheses on G, G', and j merely choose subgroup models and spell out that canonical map.
For n=1 torsion consists of the identity; for a genus-zero curve both groups are trivial.
The conclusion does not assert anything about an affine quotient or a boundary subgroup. -/
