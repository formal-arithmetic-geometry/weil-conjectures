/-- A dense open of a curve can be shrunk to a finite disjoint union of irreducible opens.
Source: Stacks Project, Theorem 03SC, proof, third paragraph
(blueprint: `lem-pbc-q1-dense-irreducible-opens`).

Proof: A finite-type scheme over a field is Noetherian and has finitely many irreducible
components C_a, each with a generic point. A dense open V contains every generic point:
its intersection with the open part of C_a outside all other components is nonempty,
and an open containing a specialization of the generic point contains that generic point.
Remove from V the union of the intersections of distinct components. These intersections
are closed, contain no generic point, and have dimension at most zero, since every component
has dimension at most one. The remainder W is open and contains every generic point, hence
is dense. Its intersections U_a with the components are nonempty irreducible opens, pairwise
disjoint, and cover W. Each is closed in W as well, since its complement is a finite union
of the other opens. Thus the connected component in W of a point of U_a is exactly U_a:
irreducibility implies connectedness, and a connected set cannot cross a clopen partition.
The complement of W is closed and contains no generic point. Every point in it is closed,
since a non-generic point of a component of dimension at most one has zero-dimensional
irreducible closure. Noetherianity makes this complement a finite set of closed points,
so its topological Krull dimension is at most zero. If X is empty, take n = 0; all density
and component conditions are vacuous and the empty complement has dimension bottom. -/
