/-- Order is invariant under compatible isomorphisms of local rings and function fields.
Source: blueprint, sec-curve-estimates/sk-prop-cd-affine/lem-sc-pic-affine, first paragraph,
restriction and boundary divisors.

Proof: if the common coheight is not one, both orders are zero by definition. Otherwise
both stalks are Noetherian domains of Krull dimension one. The local ring equivalence
identifies the principal quotients by r and by e(r), including their submodule lattices;
therefore their module lengths agree. Thus the ring order maps agree on all nonzero stalk
elements. Every function-field element is a quotient of two such elements, and the assumed
commuting square takes this quotient to the corresponding quotient in the other field.
The multiplicative fraction order maps agree by multiplicativity and the quotient formula.
For zero both orders are zero; for nonzero elements taking the additive exponent proves
the asserted equality. This includes constant units and points of other codimension. -/

/-- A principal divisor on the open curve has a principal extension with identical orders.
Source: blueprint, sec-curve-estimates/sk-prop-cd-affine/lem-sc-pic-affine, first paragraph,
restriction and boundary divisors
(blueprint: lem-sc-principal-divisor-open-extension).

Proof: a nonempty open subset of an integral scheme contains its generic point. Hence the
open immersion of the connected smooth curve into its integral compactification identifies
both generic stalks, and thus both function fields. Transport the given unit through the
inverse of this field isomorphism to a unit b on Z. At Q and its image P the open immersion
identifies local rings and the maps into the common function field. The discrete valuation
rings therefore have identical normalized valuations: a uniformizer maps to a uniformizer,
and units map to units. Applying this to the given rational function yields the displayed
coefficient equality. No choice of a divisor or trivial Picard class is used, and no boundary
order is prescribed. For a constant unit all retained orders vanish; an empty boundary
simply makes the equality hold at every ambient closed point. -/
