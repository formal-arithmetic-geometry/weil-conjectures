# The affine core of a smooth curve

A smooth curve `C` over a field which is geometrically connected has a nonempty dense affine
open subscheme whose complement is a finite set of points.

/-- **Affine core of a smooth curve.** A smooth geometrically connected curve `C` over a field
`k₀` has a nonempty dense affine open subscheme `V` whose complement is finite.

The blueprint obtains `V` by removing points from the smooth proper completion of `C`; it is
enough to take any nonempty affine open: `C` is irreducible (connected and regular), so every
nonempty open is dense, and its complement is finite since `C` is a noetherian space of
dimension one. (blueprint: `lem-a1-affine-core-of-curve`) -/
