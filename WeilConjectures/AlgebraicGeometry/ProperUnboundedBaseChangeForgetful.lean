/-- Transfer an invertible Z/nZ exchange to coefficients in a ring killed by n.
Source: coefficient restriction as in Stacks Project, Tag 0D6J, together with the
canonical unbounded mate comparison of lem-kun-unbounded-abelian-exchange-comparison.

Proof in words: the equation n times 1 = 0 defines a ring map Z/nZ to Λ by sending
an integer class to its scalar multiple of 1. Replacing an integer by a multiple of
n changes this value by zero. Restrict a representing complex C termwise along this
map, with action [a]m = (a times 1)m. The differentials remain linear, and kernels,
images, and cokernels have the same underlying abelian sheaves, so restriction
preserves quasi-isomorphisms. Let C_n denote this explicit restricted complex. Its
underlying abelian complex equals that of C. By hbase the exchange of C_n is invertible.
Apply the canonical coefficient-forgetting comparison twice, for Z/nZ and for Λ.
Writing s_A and t_A for its invertible source and target comparisons, the identity
is t_A composed with U_A(exchange_A) = exchange_abelian composed with s_A.
For C_n this expresses the abelian exchange as a composite of invertible maps.
The equality of underlying complexes makes it the same abelian exchange for C;
the second identity therefore makes U_Λ(exchange_Λ) invertible. Exact coefficient
forgetting commutes with homology and reflects isomorphisms: a bijective map of
module sheaves has a module-linear inverse, and derived isomorphisms are detected
on all homology sheaves. Thus exchange_Λ at K is invertible. No properness assertion
is used in this comparison step, and n need not be positive here (ZMod 0 is ℤ). -/
