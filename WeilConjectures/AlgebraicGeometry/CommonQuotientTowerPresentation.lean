/-! # Presentations of towers of common quotient ring sheaves

Source: Stacks Project, proetale.tex, Tag 099L, section-derived-completion-noetherian;
sites-modules.tex, Tag 03EK, section-tensor-product.

A quotient is specified by its locally surjective projection, rather than by a
sectionwise surjection. Extension of its kernel ideal is specified by the pushout
universal property in ring sheaves. This includes quotients whose sections lift only locally.

/-- A tower `S_n = R/I_n = B/I_n B`, including the quotient projections and their
transition compatibility. Its ideals are the kernels of the projections from `R`.
The pushout with bottom map the identity says precisely that the projection from `B`
is the quotient by the extended ideal. Source: Stacks 099L and 03EK. -/
