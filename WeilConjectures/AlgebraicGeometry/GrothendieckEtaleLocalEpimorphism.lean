/-- Maps admitting local lifts through a sheaf epimorphism jointly detect zero maps.
Source: Stacks Project, Sites, Tag 00WL, the image subsheaf argument, and
Hypercoverings, Tag 01H0, the local primitive step. This is the categorical
finite-cover version for Grothendieck abelian coefficients.

Proof: define the local image at each etale object as the union of subobjects whose
inclusions lift locally after an epimorphism onto their source. These subobjects form a
small directed family: use well-poweredness for smallness, and biproducts and intersection
of covering sieves for directedness. Restriction preserves the family. Extend from qcqs
objects by intersecting the pullbacks of their local-image subobjects over all qcqs tests.
This constructs a subpresheaf of G containing the image of p.

The union pulls back to the whole source of any map factoring through it, by AB5.
For each pulled-back member, pull back its witnessing epimorphism. The resulting map into
the source has local lifts. The vanishing hypothesis kills it; cancel the epimorphism.
All the pulled-back members therefore lie in the kernel of g, and their union is the
whole source. This proves the detection assertion for maps into the local image.

To show that the constructed subpresheaf is a sheaf, first prove finite-cover descent
for factoring through the local image. Compose a proposed map with the cokernel of the
local-image inclusion. When all its restrictions actually lift locally, transitivity of
covering sieves kills this composite. Remove those lifting assumptions one cover member
at a time using the detection assertion and finite induction. Thus factorization through
the local image descends along a finite cover. For an arbitrary compatible family, glue
it in G. Pull the covering sieve back to each qcqs test object, refine to a finite affine
cover, and apply finite-cover descent. The glued map factors through the constructed
subpresheaf. Monicity gives uniqueness, so it is a subsheaf.

The factorization of p through this subsheaf makes its inclusion epic. It is also monic,
hence an isomorphism in the abelian sheaf category. On qcqs W the extended local image
equals the original one, which is therefore top. Apply the detection assertion to x.
Neither a fixed projective source nor factorization through one stage of a directed union
is used. Empty finite covers, empty W, zero coefficients, and zero source are included. -/
