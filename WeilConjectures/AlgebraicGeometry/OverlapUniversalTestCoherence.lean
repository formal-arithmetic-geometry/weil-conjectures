/-- Raw transition coherence follows from diagonal and universal triple tests.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01ZR, first proof, Zariski gluing.

Proof: Pull each tested diagonal identity along an arbitrary chart map. For an
arbitrary triple of chart maps with common image in the base, the universal
property of the chosen threefold pullback supplies their common lift. Pull the
tested triple equation along that lift. Naturality identifies all three pulled
maps with the supplied transition maps. The pseudofunctor comparison isomorphisms
cancel and its pullback functor preserves identity and composition. -/
