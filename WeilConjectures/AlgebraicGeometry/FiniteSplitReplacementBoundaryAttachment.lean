Let the new top object be the coproduct of N and the old nondegenerate objects
indexed by proper surjections [n+1] to [m], m at most n. On N, use b followed by
the projections of Q for every lower operator; on an old summand use its inclusion
and the old simplicial operator. To define a degeneracy from an old degree, use
its splitting cofan: concatenate the new surjection with the summand label. For
an arbitrary map into the top degree factor it as an epimorphism followed by a
monomorphism. Apply the prescribed proper face followed by the concatenated
surjection; a full-image self-map is the identity. Check composition after the
splitting coproduct injections. On old summands this is functoriality of A; on N
it is Q.naturality, together with uniqueness of epi--mono factorization. Thus
these formulas define the extended truncated simplicial object and its splitting.
Define its map to K on N by g and on old degenerate summands by A.f followed by
the corresponding degeneracy of K. The displayed compatibility gives naturality
on N; naturality of A.f gives it on the other summands. The new matching object
is Q.M, its projections are Q.π, and its universal property is Q.universal. Its
matching map restricts to b on N, so is surjective. The supplied finite coproduct
of N supplies the top finiteness property; all lower properties are retained.
Use the original objects, maps and matching witnesses in the old degrees, so
restriction is literally A (proof fields agree by proof irrelevance).
This theorem performs only the simplicial attachment: the matching object and
its finite covering lift into K are already supplied, and no hypercover
hypothesis on K is used. -/
