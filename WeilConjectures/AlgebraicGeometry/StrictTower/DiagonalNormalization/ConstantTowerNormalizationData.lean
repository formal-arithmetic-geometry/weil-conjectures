Source: Stacks Project, Tags 08BJ, 070K and 07A7.

These abbreviations expose the existing constructions through a definition-owned interface.
They do not use the conclusion of `constantTowerDirectImageNormalization` or its coefficient
completeness hypothesis. The diagonal K-injective instance is re-exported with the same data.
