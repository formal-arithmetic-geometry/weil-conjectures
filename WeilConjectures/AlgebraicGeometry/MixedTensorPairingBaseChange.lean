/-- Base change transports an arbitrary tensor pairing. This is independent of internal
Hom: `a` is any morphism from a tensor product, with no closed structure involved.

Proof: first take a to be the identity on A tensor B and transpose under the f'
pullback/direct-image adjunction. Expand both base-change components by Remark 08HY.
Naturality of the f' counit and its triangle identity remove the f' unit-counit pairs.
The tensor of the two remaining f counits agrees with the f counit used in the
right-adjoint tensor pairing, by its definition. The remaining identity states that
pullback-composition comparisons preserve the normalized tensorators. On K-flat
representatives this is the ordinary module pullback-composition tensor identity:
both composites send a pure tensor of sections to the tensor of the same two
pulled-back sections. The normalization equations for the tensorators and the
composition comparisons, and the invertible K-flat derived counits, transport the
identity to the derived category. K-flat resolutions and naturality extend it to
arbitrary A and B. Finally postcompose with direct image of pulled-back a. Naturality
of the base-change mate in A tensor B moves a to the right side, and functoriality
gives the stated identity. No base-change morphism is cancelled or assumed invertible. -/
