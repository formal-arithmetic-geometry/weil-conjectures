# A projective modification of a proper scheme

Over a Noetherian base `S`, a proper `X ⟶ S` is dominated by a projective `S`-scheme through a
proper morphism which is an isomorphism over a dense open subset of `X`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_projective_modification`, blueprint
`lem-fin-noetherian-chow-modification`). This is Chow's lemma
(`AlgebraicGeometry.ChowModification`) for proper morphisms.

/-- Blueprint `lem-fin-noetherian-chow-modification`: A projective modification of a reduced
proper scheme.

Let `S` be Noetherian and `f : X ⟶ S` proper. There are a proper map `π : Y ⟶ X` and a dense open
`U ⊆ X` such that `π⁻¹(U) ⟶ U` is an isomorphism and `Y ⟶ S` is projective: `π ≫ f` factors as
a closed immersion `e : Y ⟶ ℙ(N; S)` followed by the structure morphism, for a finite index type
`N` of homogeneous coordinates. The blueprint takes `S` affine and `X` reduced; neither is
needed. The modification is moreover surjective. -/
