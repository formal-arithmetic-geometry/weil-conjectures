# Proper schemes over an affine base are dominated by projective ones

Let `f : X ⟶ Y` be a proper morphism with `Y` affine, but with no Noetherian or finite
presentation hypothesis. Then there are a proper surjective morphism `π : X̃ ⟶ X` and a closed
immersion `i : X̃ ⟶ ℙ(n; Y)` over `Y`, with `n` finite. We bundle such data into
`AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveDomination f`, prove that it exists
(`AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveDomination.nonempty_of_isAffine`) and that it is stable under base
change on `Y` (`AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveDomination.pullback`).

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveDomination f` — a proper surjection onto `X` from a closed
  subscheme of a projective space over `Y`, compatibly with `f`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveDomination.pullback` — its base change along `Y' ⟶ Y`.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveDomination.nonempty_of_isAffine` — a proper morphism to an
  affine scheme admits a projective domination.

## Implementation notes

The proof never descends `X` itself. The separated finitely presented envelope `X ⟶ X'` of
`f` (Stacks Project Tag 01ZJ) descends to a separated finitely presented `X₀' ⟶ Y₀` over a
stage `Y₀` of a Noetherian approximation of `Y` (Stacks Project Tag 01ZQ). Chow's lemma over
the Noetherian `Y₀` (`AlgebraicGeometry.ChowModification`) dominates `X₀'` by a scheme
immersed into `ℙ(n; Y₀)`; we base change it to `X'`, restrict it to the closed subscheme `X`,
and the immersion obtained is closed since its source is proper over `Y`.

/-- **Proper schemes over an affine base are dominated by projective ones.** Let `f : X ⟶ Y`
be proper with `Y` affine; no Noetherian or finite presentation hypothesis is imposed. Then
there are a proper surjection `π : X̃ ⟶ X` and a closed immersion `i : X̃ ⟶ ℙ(n; Y)` over `Y`,
with `n` finite.

The separated finitely presented envelope `X ⟶ X'` of `f` (Stacks Project Tag 01ZJ) is the base
change of a separated finitely presented `X₀' ⟶ Y₀` over a stage `Y₀` of the Noetherian
approximation of `Y` (Stacks Project Tag 01ZQ). Chow's lemma over `Y₀` gives a proper surjection
`π₀ : X₀'' ⟶ X₀'` and an immersion `X₀'' ⟶ ℙ(n; Y₀)`; base changing `π₀` along `X' ⟶ X₀'` and
then along `X ⟶ X'` gives `π`, and the induced morphism to `ℙ(n; Y)` is an immersion whose
source is proper over `Y`, hence a closed immersion.
