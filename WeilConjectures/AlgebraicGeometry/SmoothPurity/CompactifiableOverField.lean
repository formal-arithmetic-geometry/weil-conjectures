# Compactifiability over a field

Source: Weil conjectures/sk-prop-sf-cbc; Stacks Project, Tags 0ATT, 0F41.

The defining clause uses the existing `AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.HasCompactification`: a scheme `Z`, an open immersion `i`, a proper
morphism `g`, and the equality `f = i ≫ g`. No new compactifiability predicate is introduced.
The statement below records the node's additional existence assertion over a field.

/-- A separated finite-type morphism between finite-type schemes over a field is compactifiable.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 01OV, 01T6, 01OY, 0F41.

Here `HasCompactification f` means that a factorization `f = i ≫ g` exists, with `i` an
open immersion and `g` proper, as recorded by the existing structure `Compactification f`.

Proof, step 1: every ideal of the field is zero or the unit ideal, hence finitely generated
. Thus its spectrum is locally Noetherian (pqf-def-locnoeth)
and quasi-compact, hence Noetherian.
Step 2: finite type over this spectrum makes `S` Noetherian
. In particular it is quasi-compact and locally
Noetherian, hence quasi-separated.
Step 3: apply theorem-nagata-s-compactification-theorem--1 to the separated finite-type morphism `f`
and this quasi-compact quasi-separated target. Its compactification witnesses the conclusion.
This assertion places no restriction on arbitrary morphisms used for base change. -/
