/-- Dense fibre opens contain component generic points.

Proof: For t in U, the fibre is isomorphic to a fibre of the restricted locally finitely presented
morphism. It is locally of finite type over the residue field and hence locally noetherian. Fix a
component generic point z and choose a noetherian affine open neighbourhood A of z. The
intersection of its component with A is an irreducible component of A and has generic point z.
There are finitely many components of A. Remove all the other components; the resulting open O
contains z and is contained in its component, and is nonempty. The dense open W intersects O in a
point y. Since y belongs to the closure of z, z generalizes y; openness of W forces z to lie in W.
This proves the inclusion for every component generic point. Empty fibres have no component
generic points. -/
