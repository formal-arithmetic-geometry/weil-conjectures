Proof: Associate to a morphism its graph, a section of the second projection.
The projection is finite étale. Its section is étale by cancellation, a monomorphism
by its retraction, and a closed immersion by separatedness. Thus it is an open and
closed immersion. Its image W is clopen, and its factorization through W is an
isomorphism whose inverse is the restricted projection. Conversely, for such W,
compose the inverse of its projection with its inclusion and then the first projection.
The pullback identities give a morphism over the base. The two constructions are
inverse: a section is recovered from its image because the restricted projection
has a unique inverse. This also treats an empty source or target. -/
