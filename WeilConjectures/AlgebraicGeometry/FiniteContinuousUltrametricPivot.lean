/-! # A local dominating member of a finite family of continuous functions -/

/-- A finite family of continuous functions into an ultrametric normed field has a
nowhere-zero dominating member near any point where some member is nonzero.

Source: the continuous-function pivot argument in the integral coefficient application
of Bhatt--Scholze, Section 6.8. Choose a member with maximum norm at the point. Its norm
is positive. Intersect, over the finite family, the open loci where the difference from
its value at the point has norm below this maximum. The ultrametric inequality bounds
all functions by the maximum there, and the isosceles triangle identity keeps the
selected function's norm equal to the positive maximum. -/
