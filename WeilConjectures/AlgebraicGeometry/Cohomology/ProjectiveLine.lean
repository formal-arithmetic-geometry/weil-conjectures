# Coherent cohomology of the projective line and of smooth projective curves

Let `k` be a field and `ℙ¹_k = ProjectiveLine (Spec k)`. This file records the cohomology of the
twisting sheaves `𝒪(d)` on `ℙ¹_k`, the vanishing of the cohomology of quasi-coherent sheaves on
`ℙ¹_k` in degrees `≥ 2`, the finiteness of the cohomology of coherent sheaves on `ℙ¹_k`, and the
finiteness of the cohomology of coherent sheaves on a smooth projective curve.

The twisting sheaves are `AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveSpace.twist`, which exist and are
invertible by `AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveSpace.isInvertible_twist` (blueprint
`lem-sc-p1-twist-exists`). The cohomology of the twists on `ℙ¹_k` is the case `d = 1` of
Serre's computation of the cohomology of `ℙᵈ_k`, `sk-thm-picard-pn`.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveLine.nonempty_H_zero_twist_equiv_twistSectionPairs`: the global
  sections of `𝒪(d)` are the pairs `(p, q)` with `p(t) = tᵈ q(1/t)`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveLine.nonempty_H_zero_twist_equiv`,
  `subsingleton_H_zero_twist_of_neg`, `subsingleton_H_one_twist`,
  `nonempty_H_one_twist_equiv_dual` and `nonempty_relativeDifferentials_iso_twist`: the
  cohomology of the twists, and `Ω¹_{ℙ¹/k} ≅ 𝒪(-2)`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveLine.subsingleton_H_of_two_le`: `H^q(ℙ¹_k, ℱ) = 0` for `q ≥ 2`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveLine.finiteDimensional_H`: `H⁰` and `H¹` of a coherent sheaf on
  `ℙ¹_k` are finite-dimensional.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.finiteDimensional_H_of_isCurve`: the cohomology of a coherent sheaf on a
  smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field is finite-dimensional, and vanishes
  in degrees `≥ 2`.
