# Derived extension of global scalars along a flat morphism

For a flat morphism `g : T ⟶ S` of affine schemes, extension of scalars along
`g^♯ : Γ(S, ⊤) → Γ(T, ⊤)` is exact, and the functor it induces on derived categories is the
derived extension of scalars `AlgebraicGeometry.mixedGlobalExtension g`: both are left adjoint
to the derived restriction of scalars.
