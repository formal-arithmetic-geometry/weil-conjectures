# Effective descent for projective schemes over an arbitrary base

Let `p : X ⟶ Y` be a surjective finite locally free morphism and let `V` be a scheme over `X`
whose structure morphism is (H-)projective. Every descent datum on `V` relative to `p` is
effective (Stacks 0CCJ).

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsHProjective.exists_isAffineOpen_superset`: if `f : V ⟶ X` is H-projective
  and `W ⊆ X` is an affine open, every finite set of points of `f⁻¹ W` lies in an affine open of
  `V` (Stacks 01ZY).
- `CategoryTheory.Over.DescentDatum.isEffective_of_isFinite_of_fibre`: along a surjective finite
  locally free morphism, descent data are effective as soon as every finite set of points of `V`
  lying over one point of `Y` lies in an affine open (Stacks 0CCI).
- `CategoryTheory.Over.DescentDatum.isEffective_of_isHProjective`: along a surjective finite
  locally free morphism, descent data on H-projective schemes over `X` are effective (blueprint
  `thm-pd-effective-descent`).

## Proof

Finitely many points of `V` over one point `y` of `Y` lie over an affine open `W ∋ y` of `Y`,
hence over the affine open `p⁻¹ W` of `X`. The base change of the closed immersion
`V ⟶ ℙ(n; X)` to `p⁻¹ W` is a closed immersion of the open `V|_{p⁻¹ W}` into `ℙ(n; p⁻¹ W)`, so
the points lie in an affine open (`exists_isAffineOpen_superset_of_isImmersion_of_isAffine`).
This is the criterion of Stacks 0CCI: it gives invariant affine neighbourhoods over affine opens
of `Y`, on which the descent datum is effective by affine descent, and these glue.

/-- **Effective descent for projective schemes.** Let `p : X ⟶ Y` be a surjective finite locally
free morphism and let `V` be a scheme over `X` whose structure morphism `V ⟶ X` is H-projective:
it factors as a closed immersion `V ⟶ ℙ(n; X)`, with `n` finite, followed by the projection
`ℙ(n; X) ⟶ X` (in particular this applies when `V ⟶ X` is projective,
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsProjective`). Then every descent datum on `V` relative to `p` is effective.

This is Stacks 0CCJ: finitely many points of `V` over one point of `Y` lie in an affine open
(`AlgebraicGeometry.IsHProjective.exists_isAffineOpen_superset`), which is the criterion
`isEffective_of_isFinite_of_fibre` (Stacks 0CCI).
