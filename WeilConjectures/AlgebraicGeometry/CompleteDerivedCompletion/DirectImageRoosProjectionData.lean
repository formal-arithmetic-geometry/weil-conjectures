/-- The canonical counit projections form the first map of the Milnor triangle.

Proof: resolve a strict tower by a termwise injective K-injective tower I. Its
inverse limit is the kernel of the product difference 1-shift, and this difference
is degreewise surjective. The resulting short exact sequence gives a distinguished
triangle. Exact countable products identify its two product terms with products
of derived evaluations. The canonical derived adjunction counit on I is the image
of the ordinary constant-limit counit. Evaluating it and cancelling the canonical
constant-evaluation isomorphism identifies its nth component with the ordinary
limit projection. Thus the triangle's first map is Pi.lift of levelProjection.
Naturality of the derived comparison and counit transports the triangle along
the resolution isomorphism to every derived tower. -/
