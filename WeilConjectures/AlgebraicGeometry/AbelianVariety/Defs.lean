# Abelian varieties

Following Mathlib, a group scheme over a field `K` is an object `A` of `Over (Spec (.of K))`
equipped with `CategoryTheory.GrpObj A`. An *abelian variety* is such an `A` whose structure
morphism is proper and smooth and whose underlying space is connected.

The group structure is deliberately **not** a parameter of `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAbelianVariety`:
were it one, `IsAbelianVariety A` would be a different proposition for each `GrpObj A` instance
in scope. A declaration about abelian varieties therefore takes `[GrpObj A] [IsAbelianVariety A]`
side by side.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAbelianVariety`: proper, smooth and connected over `K`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAbelianVariety.dim`: the dimension of an abelian variety.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAbelianVariety.topologicalKrullDim_eq`: the Krull dimension of an abelian
  variety is the natural number `IsAbelianVariety.dim`.

/-- Blueprint `sk-def-av`: Abelian varieties.

An *abelian variety* over a field `K` is a group scheme over `K` which is proper, smooth and
connected; its *dimension* is `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAbelianVariety.dim`, the Krull dimension of
its underlying space.

This is also blueprint `def-sc-abelian-variety`. As blueprint `rem-ptr-sc-abelian-variety-1`
records, that these are exactly the complete group varieties is
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsAbelianVariety.geometricallyIntegral` (blueprint
`lem-sc-abelian-variety-characterization`). -/
