# Rigidity

The rigidity lemma says that a morphism `g : X ×_K Y ⟶ Z` of `K`-schemes, with `X` proper,
geometrically connected and geometrically reduced over `K`, `Y` connected and `Z` separated over
`K`, which contracts a single fibre `X ×_K {y₀}` to a point, necessarily factors through the
second projection. This file also records two propositions on the fibres of the morphism
`(g, pr₂) : X ×_K Y ⟶ Z ×_K Y` over `Y`: the locus of `y` whose geometric fibre is contracted to
a point is closed, and the locus of `y` whose fibre has finite image is open. The second one is
independent of the rigidity lemma.

All three statements are set in the commutative square

```

```

in which `hg : g ≫ fZ = pullback.fst fX fY ≫ fX` says that `g` is a morphism of `K`-schemes.
The fibres of `(g, pr₂) = pullback.lift g (pullback.snd fX fY) _` over `Y` are spelled with
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.fiberMap`.

The blueprint uses the rigidity lemma to prove that abelian varieties are commutative. That
corollary is proved instead in `WeilConjectures.AlgebraicGeometry.AbelianVariety.Basic` from
Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.isCommMonObj_of_isProper_of_geometricallyIntegral`, so the results
below are recorded for their own sake and have no consumer in this repository yet.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.isClosed_setOf_subsingleton_range_fiberMap`: for a morphism `F : A ⟶ B` over
  `Y` with `A` universally open and locally of finite type and `B` separated over `Y`, the locus
  of `y : Y` whose geometric fibre `F_ȳ` has subsingleton image is closed in `Y`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.isClosed_setOf_subsingleton_image`: the locus of `y : Y` whose geometric
  fibre is contracted to a single point is closed in `Y`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.eventually_finite_image`: if the fibre over `y₀` has finite image, then so
  does the fibre over every `y` near `y₀`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_mem_and_comp_eq_of_subsingleton_image`: if `g` contracts the fibre
  over `y`, then `g` factors through the second projection over a neighbourhood of `y`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_eq_snd_comp`: the rigidity lemma, `g` factors through the second
  projection.

/-- The general form of blueprint `lem-sc-constant-locus-closed`. Let `F : A ⟶ B` be a morphism
of schemes over `Y`, with `a : A ⟶ Y` universally open and locally of finite type and with
`b : B ⟶ Y` separated. Then the locus of `y : Y` such that the base change
`F_ȳ : A_{κ(y)‾} ⟶ B_{κ(y)‾}` of `F` along the geometric point `ȳ` over `y` has subsingleton
image is closed.

Following the blueprint, write `Φ : A ×_Y A ⟶ B ×_Y B` for the product of `F` with itself and
`π : A ×_Y A ⟶ Y` for the projection. The locus is the complement of the image under `π` of the
open set `U` of points that `Φ` sends off the diagonal of `b`, and `π` is an open map. To see
that `y` lies outside `π(U)` exactly when the image of `F_ȳ` is a subsingleton, base change
along `ȳ`: the diagonal of `B_{κ(y)‾}` is the preimage of the diagonal of `b`
(`Scheme.Pullback.map_fst_mem_range_diagonal_iff`), and if the image of `F_ȳ` is a single point
then that point is a `κ(y)‾`-point, since `A_{κ(y)‾}` has a closed, hence rational, point. -/

/-- Blueprint `sk-prop-av-const-locus`: The locus of constant fibres is closed

Let `X` be a `K`-scheme proper over `K`, let `Z` be separated over `K`, let `Y` be any
`K`-scheme and let `g : X ×_K Y ⟶ Z` be a morphism of `K`-schemes. For `y : Y` let
`g_ȳ : X_{κ(y)‾} ⟶ Z_{κ(y)‾}` be the base change of `(g, pr₂) : X ×_K Y ⟶ Z ×_K Y` along the
geometric point `ȳ` over `y`. Then the locus `L = {y ∈ Y | g_ȳ(X_{κ(y)‾}) is a subsingleton}` is
closed in `Y`. For nonempty `X` the image of `g_ȳ` is a subsingleton exactly when it is a single
point.

Constancy must be tested on the geometric fibre, not on the set-theoretic image of
`X ×_K {y}` in `Z`: for `K` algebraically closed of characteristic `≠ 2`,
`X = Spec K ⊔ Spec K`, `Y = Z = 𝔸¹_K` and `g = (t ↦ t, t ↦ -t)`, that image is one point
exactly for `y` the generic point or `y = 0`, which is not a closed set. -/

Let `X` be proper over `K`, let `Z` be separated and locally of finite type over `K`, let
`g : X ×_K Y ⟶ Z` be a morphism of `K`-schemes and let `y₀ ∈ Y`. For `y : Y` let
`g_y : X_{κ(y)} ⟶ Z_{κ(y)}` be the fibre of `(g, pr₂) : X ×_K Y ⟶ Z ×_K Y` over `y`. If the
image of `g_{y₀}` is finite, then the image of `g_y` is finite for every `y` in some open
neighbourhood of `y₀`. This is also blueprint `lem-sc-finite-image-locus-open`.

Following the blueprint, apply Stacks Tag 0AH8
(`exists_finite_imageι_comp_morphismRestrict_of_finite_image_preimage`) to `h = (g, pr₂)` over
`Y`: as `h ≫ pr₂ = pr₂` is proper and `pr₂ : Z ×_K Y ⟶ Y` is separated and locally of finite type,
the image of `h` is finite over an open neighbourhood `U` of `y₀`, so its fibres over the points of
`U` are finite. The image of `g_y` is identified with `h (pr₂⁻¹ {y})` by
`Scheme.Hom.finite_range_fiberMap_iff`.

The rigidity lemma `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_eq_snd_comp` does not depend on this result. -/

/-- Step 4 of blueprint `lem-sc-rigidity` (`sk-prop-av-rigidity`): if `X` is proper,
geometrically connected and geometrically reduced over `K` and `g : X ×_K Y ⟶ Z` contracts the
fibre `X ×_K {y}` of the second projection `pr₂` to a point, then `g` factors through `pr₂` over
an open neighbourhood `U` of `y`: there is `h : U ⟶ Z` over `K` such that `a ≫ g = b ≫ h`
whenever `a : T ⟶ X ×_K Y` and `b : T ⟶ U` agree in `Y`.

Following the blueprint, choose an affine open `V` around the image point. As `pr₂` is closed,
`Y ∖ pr₂ (g⁻¹ (Z ∖ V))` is an open neighbourhood of `y`; choose an affine open `U` around `y`
inside it, so that `g` maps `X ×_K U` into `V`. Since `Γ(X, 𝒪_X) = K` (Stacks 0BUG), flat base
change gives `Γ(X ×_K U, 𝒪) = Γ(U, 𝒪_U)`, so the morphism `X ×_K U ⟶ V` to the affine scheme

/-- Blueprint `sk-prop-av-rigidity`: The rigidity lemma

Let `X`, `Y`, `Z` be `K`-schemes with `X` proper, geometrically connected and geometrically
reduced over `K`, with `Y` connected and with `Z` separated over `K`, and let
`g : X ×_K Y ⟶ Z` be a morphism of `K`-schemes. If `g (X ×_K {y₀})` is a single point for some
point `y₀ ∈ Y`, then `g` factors through the second projection: `g = pr₂ ≫ h` for some
`h : Y ⟶ Z`, that is, the triangle

```
  pullback fX fY ─── pullback.snd ──▶ Y
             ╲                        │
              ╲  g                    │ h
               ╲                      ▼
                ╲──────────────────▶ Z
```

commutes. The set `g (X ×_K {y₀})` is spelled as the range of the restriction of `g` to the
scheme-theoretic fibre of `pr₂` over `y₀`; the point `y₀` need not be `K`-rational.

Neither geometric hypothesis on `X` can be dropped on its own. For `K = ℝ`, `X = Spec ℂ`,
`Y = 𝔸¹_ℝ`, `Z = 𝔸¹_ℂ` and `g` the identity of `X ×_K Y = 𝔸¹_ℂ`, `X` is connected and
geometrically reduced but not geometrically connected, and `g` does not factor. For `K`
imperfect of characteristic `p`, `a ∈ K ∖ K^p`, `K' = K(a^{1/p})`, `X = Spec K'`, `Y = 𝔸¹_K`,
`Z = 𝔸¹_{K'}` and `g` the identity of `X ×_K Y = 𝔸¹_{K'}`, `X` is geometrically connected and
reduced but not geometrically reduced, and `g` does not factor since `pr₂ : 𝔸¹_{K'} ⟶ 𝔸¹_K` is
not a monomorphism. In both examples `Γ(X, 𝒪_X) ≠ K`.

This is also blueprint `lem-sc-rigidity`. The proof follows the blueprint with one change: `L`
is the set of `y` near which `g` factors through `pr₂`. It is open by definition and contains
`y₀` by `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_mem_and_comp_eq_of_subsingleton_image` (Step 4). The same
lemma shows that `L` is the locus of `AlgebraicGeometry.isClosed_setOf_subsingleton_image`, so
it is closed, hence `L = Y` as `Y` is connected. The local factorizations glue because `pr₂` is
flat, surjective and quasi-compact, hence an effective epimorphism. This route needs neither
Step 2 (`AlgebraicGeometry.eventually_finite_image`) nor `Z` locally of finite type, nor `y₀`
`K`-rational. -/
