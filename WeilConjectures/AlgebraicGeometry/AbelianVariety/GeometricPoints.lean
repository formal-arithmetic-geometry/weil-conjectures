# Geometric points of an abelian variety over an arbitrary field

Let `A` be an abelian variety over a field `K`. Its group `A(K̄)` of geometric points, the
morphisms `Spec K̄ ⟶ A` over `K`, is the group of `K̄`-points of the base change `A_{K̄}`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.geometricPointsAddEquivBaseChangePoints`, which holds for any group
scheme). Hence the results over algebraically closed fields apply: for `ℓ ≠ char K`, the group
`A(K̄)` is `ℓ`-divisible and its `ℓ ^ n`-torsion is finite.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAbelianVariety.exists_zsmul_eq_geometricPoints`: `A(K̄)` is divisible.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAbelianVariety.finite_torsionBy_geometricPoints`: `A(K̄)[ℓ ^ n]` is
  finite.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAbelianVariety.exists_overIso_sigma_torsionSubgroupScheme`: for `n` prime
  to `char K`, `A[n]` becomes a disjoint union of `n ^ (2 * g)` points over a separably closed
  extension.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAbelianVariety.nonempty_addEquiv_torsionBy_points`: for `n` prime to
  `char K` and `K'` an algebraically closed extension, `A(K')[n] ≅ (ℤ/nℤ) ^ (2 * g)`.

Let `A` be an abelian variety of dimension `g` over a field `K` of characteristic `p`, let `n` be
prime to `p` and let `K'` be a separably closed field extension of `K`. Then the base change
`A[n]_{K'}` is, as a scheme over `K'`, the disjoint union of `n ^ (2 * g)` copies of `Spec K'`:
it is the constant scheme on a set with `n ^ (2 * g)` elements.

`A[n]` is finite étale of order `n ^ (2 * g)` (`AlgebraicGeometry.etale_torsionSubgroupScheme`,
`AlgebraicGeometry.finrankΓ_torsionSubgroupScheme`), the order is invariant under base change,
and a finite étale scheme over a separably closed field is a disjoint union of copies of the
base (`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.exists_overIso_sigma_of_isSepClosed`). -/

/-- Blueprint `lem-sc-mult-n-etale-kernel`: Multiplication by `d` prime to the characteristic

Let `A` be an abelian variety of dimension `g` over a field `K` of characteristic `p`, let `n` be
prime to `p` and let `K'` be an algebraically closed field extension of `K`. Then the
`n`-torsion of the group `A(K')` of `K'`-valued points of `A` (the morphisms `Spec K' ⟶ A` over
`K`) is `(ℤ/nℤ) ^ (2 * g)`.

`A(K')` is the group of `K'`-points of the abelian variety `A_{K'}`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.pointsAddEquivBaseChangePoints`), hence divisible. For a prime
`ℓ ∣ n`, the `ℓ`-torsion of `A(K')` is the set of `K'`-points of `A[ℓ]`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.torsionByEquivHom`), that is of the finite étale `A[ℓ]_{K'}`, which has
`ℓ ^ (2 * g)` of them (`AlgebraicGeometry.card_points_eq_finrankΓ`); then
`AddSubgroup.nonempty_addEquiv_torsionBy_of_forall_prime` concludes. -/
