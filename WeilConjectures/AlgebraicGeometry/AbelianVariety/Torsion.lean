# The `n`-torsion of an abelian variety

For `n` prime to the characteristic, the `n`-torsion subgroup scheme of an abelian variety is
étale; over an algebraically closed field its points do not change under extension of
algebraically closed fields, and for an abelian variety of dimension `g` the group of
`n`-torsion points is `(ℤ/nℤ) ^ (2 * g)`.

The group `A(K)` of `K`-points of `A` is `𝟙_ (Over (Spec (.of K))) ⟶ A` with the group structure
of `CategoryTheory.GrpObj.Hom.group`; it is written additively as
`Additive (𝟙_ (Over (Spec (.of K))) ⟶ A)`, so that `AddSubgroup.torsionBy` describes its
`n`-torsion.

"Prime to the characteristic" is spelled `¬ p ∣ n`, which for `p = 0` says exactly `n ≠ 0`.

The proofs follow the blueprint: `A[n]` is finite of order `n ^ (2 * g)`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.finrankΓ_torsionSubgroupScheme`), hence étale
(`AlgebraicGeometry.etale_of_not_dvd_finrankΓ`), so its points over an algebraically closed
field are counted by `AlgebraicGeometry.card_points_eq_finrankΓ`; together with divisibility of
`A(K)` this determines the group `A(K)[n]`
(`AddSubgroup.nonempty_addEquiv_torsionBy_of_forall_prime`).

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.etale_torsionSubgroupScheme`: the `n`-torsion of an abelian variety is
  étale for `n` prime to the characteristic.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.etale_npow_id`: equivalently, multiplication by `n` is étale.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.bijective_toUnit_comp_torsionSubgroupScheme`: its points do not change
  under an extension of algebraically closed fields.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.nonempty_addEquiv_torsionBy`: `A(K)[n] ≃+ (ℤ/nℤ) ^ (2 * g)`.

/-- Blueprint `sk-prop-av-ntorsion-etale`: The `n`-torsion of an abelian variety is étale.

Let `A` be an abelian variety over a field `K` of characteristic `p` and let `n` be prime to
`p`. Then `A[n]` is an étale group scheme over `K`. This is also the first part of blueprint
`lem-sc-ntorsion-etale`.

`A[n]` is a finite group scheme of order `n ^ (2 * g)`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.finrankΓ_torsionSubgroupScheme`), which is prime to `p`, so it is étale by
`AlgebraicGeometry.etale_of_not_dvd_finrankΓ`. -/

/-- Blueprint `lem-sc-mult-n-etale-kernel`: Multiplication by `d` prime to the characteristic
is étale.

Let `A` be an abelian variety over a field `K` of characteristic `p` and let `n` be prime to
`p`. Then `[n] : A ⟶ A` is étale; equivalently, its kernel `A[n]` is étale
(`AlgebraicGeometry.etale_torsionSubgroupScheme`).

By translation (`CategoryTheory.GrpObj.isPullback_ker_tensor`), the base change of `[n]` along
itself is the projection `A[n] ⊗ A ⟶ A`, a base change of the étale `A[n] ⟶ Spec K`. As `[n]`
is finite, flat and surjective (`AlgebraicGeometry.isIsogeny_npow_id`), étaleness descends
along it. -/

/-- Blueprint `sk-prop-av-ntorsion-etale`: The `n`-torsion of an abelian variety is étale.

For `n` prime to the characteristic of an algebraically closed base field `K`, the canonical
base-change map `A[n](K) ⟶ A[n](K')` is a bijection for every extension `K ⊆ K'` of
algebraically closed fields. This is also the second part of blueprint `lem-sc-ntorsion-etale`.

`A[n]` is finite étale (`AlgebraicGeometry.etale_torsionSubgroupScheme`), so this is
`AlgebraicGeometry.bijective_toUnit_comp`. -/

/-- Blueprint `sk-prop-av-ntorsion-etale`: The `n`-torsion of an abelian variety is étale.

Let `A` be an abelian variety of dimension `g` over an algebraically closed field `K` of
characteristic `p` and let `n` be prime to `p`. Then `A(K)[n] ≅ (ℤ/nℤ) ^ (2 * g)`. This is also
the third part of blueprint `lem-sc-ntorsion-etale`.

The group `A(K)` is abelian and divisible (`AlgebraicGeometry.surjective_npow_points`). For a
prime `ℓ ∣ n` the `K`-points of the finite étale `A[ℓ]` are its `ℓ`-torsion
(`AlgebraicGeometry.torsionByEquiv`), so there are `ℓ ^ (2 * g)` of them
(`AlgebraicGeometry.card_points_eq_finrankΓ`), and
`AddSubgroup.nonempty_addEquiv_torsionBy_of_forall_prime` concludes. -/
