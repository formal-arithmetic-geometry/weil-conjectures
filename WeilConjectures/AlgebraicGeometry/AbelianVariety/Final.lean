# The abelian-variety estimate

The abelian-variety input to the curve estimates and the trace formula, collected from the
statements of this block: multiplication by `n` is an isogeny of degree `n ^ (2 * g)`, its
kernel is finite flat and is étale away from the characteristic, the group of `n`-torsion
points over an algebraically closed field is `(ℤ/nℤ) ^ (2 * g)` and does not change under
extension of algebraically closed fields, and the group of points is divisible with `ℓ`-adic
Tate module free of rank `2 * g`.

Each conjunct below is an instance of a single-conclusion statement proved elsewhere in the
block; the two theorems here only assemble them, splitting off the clauses that need an
algebraically closed base field, since `IsAlgClosed` is a class and is unusable as a plain
implication inside a conclusion.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.abelianVariety_estimate`: clauses (a) and (b) of the estimate, over an
  arbitrary field.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.abelianVariety_estimate_of_isAlgClosed`: clauses (c) and (d), over an
  algebraically closed field.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.surjective_comp_torsionSubgroupSchemeMul`: the transition maps
  `A[ℓ ^ (n + 1)](K̄) ⟶ A[ℓ ^ n](K̄)` of the Tate module are surjective.

/-- Abelian-variety estimate, clauses (a) and (b).

Let `A` be an abelian variety of dimension `g` over a field `K`, let `p = char K` and let
`0 < n`.

* **(a)** `[n] : A ⟶ A` is a finite flat surjective homomorphism, hence an isogeny of degree
  `n ^ (2 * g)`; `A[n] = ker [n]` is a finite flat group scheme over `K` of order `n ^ (2 * g)`.
* **(b)** If `n` is prime to `p` (in particular if `p = 0`), then `A[n]` is étale of rank
  `n ^ (2 * g)`; for `p > 0` and `n = p ^ e` clause (a) already gives that `A[p ^ e]` is finite
  flat of order `p ^ (2 * g * e)`. -/

/-- Abelian-variety estimate, clauses (c) and (d).

Let `A` be an abelian variety of dimension `g` over an algebraically closed field `K`, let
`p = char K` and let `0 < n`.

* **(c)** For `n` prime to `p` one has `A(K)[n] ≅ (ℤ/nℤ) ^ (2 * g)`, and for every extension
  `K ⊆ K'` of algebraically closed fields the canonical map `A[n](K) ⟶ A[n](K')` is a bijection.
* **(d)** `A(K)` is a divisible abelian group, and for every prime `ℓ ≠ p` one has
  `T_ℓ A ≅ ℤ_[ℓ] ^ (2 * g)` and `V_ℓ A ≅ ℚ_[ℓ] ^ (2 * g)`. -/
