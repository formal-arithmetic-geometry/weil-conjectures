/-- The diagonal torsion classes form one morphism in the derived category of
strict inverse systems, obtained by simultaneous derived reduction of the positive
integral Cartier roof. No noetherian, finiteness or nonemptiness assumption is imposed
on Y. The displayed typeclasses only choose the localization and Ext size conventions.

Proof:
1. The diagonal is a section of the smooth relative curve given by the first
   projection. Its kernel subscheme projects isomorphically to the projective
   line, so the relative Cartier criterion makes its ideal invertible.
   Form the pole extension with all integer powers of t inverse, sending it to +1.
   Exact conservative geometric stalks identify its quotient with Delta_* Z.
2. Exact comparison inverse image preserves the extension and its quotient
   quasi-isomorphism; the open--closed sequence gives the supported comparison.
   The positive cone projection is the negative of the standard Ext boundary,
   which is precisely diagonalIntegralBoundary.
3. Form the actual strict reduction functor by the cokernels specified above,
   with quotient transitions. Resolve every integral input by a flat-term K-flat
   complex. Simultaneous tensor preserves quasi-isomorphisms between these;
   the resolving-class theorem gives its pointwise left derived functor, exact
   because tensor respects shifts and mapping cones.
4. Z_l is torsion free, hence flat over Z. Exact extension is left adjoint to
   restriction, so restriction preserves K-injective strict systems and commutes
   with their inverse limits. Derive with the same resolution. The integral
   composite is Rlim_n(K tensor^L Z/l^(n+1)). The principal-ideal criterion
   of Tags 091S and 091Z identifies completeness with right orthogonality to
   all complexes on which l acts invertibly. Tag 099M supplies complete outputs
   and the natural completion unit, with bijective precomposition for every
   complete target. Thus the composite is the completion reflector, including
   its universal unit, not merely an isomorphism of the naive limit formulas.
5. Open--closed exactness shows Delta_* Z is flat and its ordinary reductions
   are the supported finite constants. These identifications preserve the units
   and every quotient transition, giving a and the normalized level maps s.
6. Kummer exactness computes the reduction of comparison units by
   [G_m --l^(n+1)--> G_m] in degrees -1,0. The resolution transition is l in
   degree -1 and identity in degree 0, hence the roots transition is zeta→zeta^l.
   Exact comparison identifies the roots with the actual pro-etale root sheaves.
   Use the negative Kummer identification, compensating the positive roof sign.
   Concentration in one cohomology degree lifts this to the strict system category.
7. The divisible-extension derived-reduction comparison fixes the complete
   supported Cartier class, not only its Chern composite. Its signed Kummer
   normalization identifies every evaluated arrow with cartierResidueReducedPro.
   The source and roots normalization equations retain the canonical finite
   identifications. Compatibility already holds because T has values in the
   derived category of strict systems, and c is its image of one boundary. -/
