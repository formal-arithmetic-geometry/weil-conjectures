/-- Base change of a `k`-scheme along a purely inseparable field extension `K/k` induces
 a homeomorphism on the underlying topological spaces.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 0BR5 and 04DF.

Proof:
1. The map `π: Spec K ⟶ Spec k` induced by `algebraMap k K` is integral, universally injective and surjective because
   `K/k` is purely inseparable.
2. Such a morphism is a universal homeomorphism by Stacks, Tag 04DF. Thus every base change
   of `π` is a homeomorphism on underlying spaces.
3. Apply this to the structure morphism `X ↘ Spec k`.
   By def-pc-base-change and def-pc-fibre-product, `X_K` is the pullback of this
   structure morphism and `π`, and its canonical map to `X` is `pullback.fst`.
   This is the projection in step 2, using symmetry of the two pullback factors. -/
