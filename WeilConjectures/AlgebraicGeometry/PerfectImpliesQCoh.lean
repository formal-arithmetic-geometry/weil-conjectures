/-- Perfect complexes have quasi-coherent cohomology.
Source: Stacks Project, Cohomology of Sheaves, Tags 08C4 and 08CM.

Proof: restrict to a neighbourhood where the perfect complex is represented by a
strictly perfect complex. Its terms are direct summands of finite free sheaves,
which are quasi-coherent; kernels and cokernels of maps between quasi-coherent
modules on a scheme are quasi-coherent. Exact restriction and locality of
quasi-coherence transfer this to every cohomology sheaf. -/
