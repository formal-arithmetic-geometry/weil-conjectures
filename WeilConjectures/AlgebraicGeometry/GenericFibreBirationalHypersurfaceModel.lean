/-- The generic fibre, without any spreading of its common opens, has a birational
geometrically integral hypersurface model whose equation has coefficients on the base.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0559, first proof, the paragraphs beginning with the generic
point of the generic fibre and ending with the polynomial quotient; Tag 0552.
Proof: Put A = Gamma(S, O_S) and K = kappa(eta) = Frac(A). The affine generic fibre
has a finitely generated geometrically integral K-algebra B. Its fraction field L
is separably generated over K and remains a domain after extension to an algebraic
closure of K. A separating transcendence basis t_1..,t_r and a primitive element z
present L as the fraction field of K[t_1..,t_r,T]/(Q), where Q is the primitive
numerator of the minimal polynomial of z. Gauss's lemma and geometric integrality
of L show that Q stays irreducible over an algebraic closure, and the resulting
hypersurface is geometrically integral. Clear the finitely many coefficient
denominators in K = Frac(A) by a nonzero scalar from A, obtaining P over A. This
scalar is a unit on the generic fibre, so it does not change the generic quotient.
The two generic integral affine schemes have isomorphic function fields over K;
express the finite sets of algebra generators as fractions in L and invert their
nonzero denominators to obtain isomorphic dense opens over K (Tag 0552).
These opens give the required generic-fibre partial isomorphism. The case of a
purely transcendental L uses Q = T in one additional variable, including L = K.
No flatness or reducedness away from the generic fibre is required. -/
