/-! # Canonical integral reduction adjunction and quotient transitions

Source: Weil conjectures blueprint, order 2132, coherent coefficient comparisons;
main-20261015, thm-pur-adic-reconstruction, normalized-system transitions.
(blueprint: def-pur-integral-reduction-transitions).

The two constructions of this node are the published declarations
`normalizedDVRIntegralAdjunction` (the tensor-unit-normalized derived adjunction
`L_n ⊣ Res_n`, the `.choose` of the published normalized adjunction) and
`normalizedDVRReductionTransition` (the inverse Hom-adjunction image under `𝔞_m` of
`η_n` followed by the inverse restriction comparison `e_{m,n}⁻¹`) of
`WeilConjectures.SmoothPurity.Normalized.NormalizedDVREffectivity`, reexported here unchanged. They are not
redeclared, so that one definition per notion is kept.
