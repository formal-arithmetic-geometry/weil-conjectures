# Smooth purity for `ℚ̄_ℓ`-coefficients on the pro-étale site

Let `ℓ` be a prime and `k` a field of characteristic `p > 0` with `p ≠ ℓ`. As in
`WeilConjectures.SixFunctors.ProEtale.ModuleObject.Derived.BoundedConstructible`, all schemes are
objects `X : Over (Spec (.of k))`, separated and of finite type over `Spec k`, and all morphisms
are morphisms `f : X ⟶ Y` of `Over (Spec (.of k))`; in particular `ℓ` is invertible on every
scheme considered. In the documentation, `X` also stands for the underlying scheme `X.left`.

Let `f : X ⟶ Y` be a morphism whose underlying morphism of schemes `f.left` is smooth of pure
relative dimension `d`. *Smooth purity* (SGA 4, Exposé XVIII, Théorème 3.2.5, and Bhatt–Scholze,
*The pro-étale topology for schemes*, Section 6.8, for `ℚ̄_ℓ`-coefficients) identifies the
exceptional inverse image of the constant coefficient object with a shifted Tate twist:
```
pur_f : Rf^! ℚ̄_ℓ,Y ≅ ℚ̄_ℓ,X(d)[2d]
```
in the derived category `D(Mod_{ℚ̄_ℓ,X})` of module objects over `ℚ̄_ℓ,X = p_X^* ℚ̲̄_ℓ`, the
pullback of the condensed ring `ℚ̲̄_ℓ` (`Profinite.padicAlgClRingObj ℓ`). Here `Rf^!` is
`AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.boundedConstructibleUpperShriek` on the bounded
constructible derived categories `Dᵇc(-)⟦ℚ̲̄_ℓ⟧` (the right adjoint of `Rf_!`, built from the
compactification of `f` chosen by Nagata's theorem), `ℚ̄_ℓ,Y` is the tensor unit of the
monoidal category `Dᵇc(Y)⟦ℚ̲̄_ℓ⟧`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.isMonoidal_boundedConstructible`), whose underlying
complex is the tensor unit of `D(Mod_{ℚ̄_ℓ,Y})`, and `ℚ̄_ℓ,X(d)` is the Tate twist of
`WeilConjectures.TateTwist.ProEtale`. The isomorphism is stated after the inclusion
`Dᵇc(X)⟦ℚ̲̄_ℓ⟧ ⥤ D(Mod_{ℚ̄_ℓ,X})`, which is fully faithful, so that the constructibility of the Tate
twists need not be recorded.

## Sorried data

The trace map `Tr_f : Rf_! ℚ̄_ℓ,X(d)[2d] ⟶ ℚ̄_ℓ,Y` of SGA 4, Exposé XVIII
(`AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.smoothTrace`) is a `@[no_expose]` definition with
value `sorry`: its construction (by reduction to relative curves and the cycle class of the
diagonal) is not formalized. The purity isomorphism
`AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.smoothPurityIso` is *defined* from it, as the inverse
of its adjoint `ℚ̄_ℓ,X(d)[2d] ⟶ Rf^! ℚ̄_ℓ,Y` for `Rf_! ⊣ Rf^!`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.smoothPurityMap`). The following properties of the
trace are `sorry`ed:

- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.isIso_smoothPurityMap`: smooth purity proper, the
  adjoint of the trace is an isomorphism;
- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.smoothPurityIso_zero_of_isOpenImmersion`: in
  relative dimension zero, for an open immersion `j`, the purity isomorphism is the canonical
  identification `Rj^! ℚ̄_ℓ ≅ j^* ℚ̄_ℓ ≅ ℚ̄_ℓ`
  (`AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.boundedConstructibleUpperShriekUnitIso_padicAlgCl`);
- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.smoothPurityIso_comp_openImmersion`: compatibility
  with composition with an open immersion `j` on the target, through the composition
  isomorphism `R(f ≫ j)^! ≅ Rj^! ⋙ Rf^!`.

These normalizations pin the trace down far more than an arbitrary isomorphism
`Rf^! ℚ̄_ℓ ≅ ℚ̄_ℓ(d)[2d]`, but not completely: the compatibility with general composition and
with base change, and the identification of the trace of a smooth curve with the classical
trace on `H²_c`, need the comparison isomorphisms of Tate twists along pullbacks and tensor
products, which are not available yet.

use it. Without it the statement is false: for `f = 𝟙` on a separably closed point and `d = 1`
it would identify the unit, in degree `0`, with a complex concentrated in degree `-2`. -/
