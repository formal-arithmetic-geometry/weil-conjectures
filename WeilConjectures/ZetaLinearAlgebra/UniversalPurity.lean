# Universal purity of an integral trace datum

Let `D` be a trace datum of length `2 * d` over an algebraically closed field `K` of
characteristic zero whose counting series has integer coefficients, and assume that for *every*
field embedding `ι : K → ℂ` the complexified reciprocal characteristic polynomial `ι (D.P i)` is
pure of weight `i`. Then `ι (D.P i)` is *universally* pure of weight `i`: every complex root `z`
is algebraic over `ℚ`, and every conjugate of `z` over `ℚ` has the same absolute value.

Algebraicity comes from the integral presentation `Z = A / B` of the counting series: the
weights separate the odd and even parity products of the `D.P i`, which are therefore the images
of `A` and `B` (`Polynomial.isAlgebraic_of_mem_roots_of_prod_mul_eq`). For the conjugates, a
root `z = ι β` with `β ∈ K` algebraic over `ℚ` and a conjugate `y` of `z` give a second
embedding `ι'` of `K` with `ι' β = y`, provided every embedding of `ℚ(β)` into `ℂ` extends to
`K`; purity for `ι'` bounds `y`. For `K = ℚ̄_ℓ` the extension property is the blueprint lemma
`lem-embedding-extension`.

## Main statements

- `TraceDatum.isUniversallyPureOfWeight_map_P`: universal purity of an integral trace datum which
  is pure for every embedding.

/-- **Universal purity of an integral trace datum** (the intrinsic-weight step of the blueprint
proof of `thm-weil-realization-independence`): if every embedding of a number field `ℚ(β) ⊆ K`
into `ℂ` extends to `K`, the counting series of `D` has integer coefficients, and `ι (D.P i)` is
pure of weight `i` for every embedding `ι : K → ℂ`, then `ι (D.P i)` is universally pure of
weight `i`. -/
