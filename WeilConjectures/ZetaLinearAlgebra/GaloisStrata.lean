# Galois weight strata of an integral polynomial

Let `ℚ̄ = AlgebraicClosure ℚ`. For an integer polynomial `C` with `C(0) = 1`, its reciprocal roots
are the roots in `ℚ̄` of the reversed polynomial `C^# = C.reverse`. For `q ∈ ℕ` and a weight `i`,
the *weight stratum* `R_i(C)` is the submultiset of those reciprocal roots that are `q`-Weil
numbers of weight `i`. This file shows (blueprint `sk-thm-intfactors`):

- `R_i(C)` is stable under `Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ)` (`prop-galois-weight-strata`);
- the stratum polynomial `Q_i = ∏_{α ∈ R_i} (1 - α T)` has integer coefficients
  (`prop-galois-weight-strata-integrality`), since its coefficients are Galois-invariant
  algebraic integers;
- the reciprocal-root multiset of `Q_i` is exactly `R_i`
  (`prop-galois-weight-strata-identification`).

It also records the `ℓ`-adic realizations of algebraic numbers (`def-weil-algebraic-closure-q`):
inside an algebraically closed field `Ω` of characteristic zero (such as `ℚ̄_ℓ`), the elements
algebraic over `ℚ` form an algebraic closure of `ℚ`, which is therefore isomorphic to `ℚ̄`.

In the blueprint, `R_i` is formed from the numerator `A` for odd `i` and from the denominator
`B` for even `i` of a normalized presentation `Z = A / B`; this is `Polynomial.parityWeilStratum`.
