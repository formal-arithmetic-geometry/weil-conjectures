# The associated graded ring of an ideal

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, proof of Lemma 05GH and Section 00JM; Artin
approximation, Section 07XA (blueprint: def-weil-pbc-associated-graded-ring).

The ring structure is the one of Mathlib's `DirectSum.commRing` for the graded
multiplication `associatedGradedMul`, so its addition and zero are those of the
direct sum by definition.
