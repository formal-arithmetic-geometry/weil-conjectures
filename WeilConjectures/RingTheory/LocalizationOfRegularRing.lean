/-- A localization of a regular ring is regular.

Source: Stacks Project, Algebra, proof of Lemma Tag 0381, Step 3
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-localization-of-regular-ring).

Give `R'` the algebra structure induced by `φ`. The three hypotheses imply
`IsLocalization M R'`: the fraction presentation gives surjectivity after multiplying by the
denominator, and applying `hzero` to `x - y` gives the equality criterion. First prove that the
canonical localization `Localization M` is regular. It is Noetherian by localization, and
Mathlib's `IsLocalization.localizationLocalizationAtPrimeIsoLocalization` identifies its
localization at any prime with the localization of `R` at the contracted prime. Transport
regular localness along this isomorphism. Finally, uniqueness of localization gives
`Localization M ≃ₐ[R] R'`, and `IsRegularRing.of_ringEquiv` transports regularity to `R'`.
This uses `lem-weil-pbc-localization-noetherian`,
`lem-weil-pbc-localization-of-localization`, and the Mathlib ring-equivalence transport lemmas.
