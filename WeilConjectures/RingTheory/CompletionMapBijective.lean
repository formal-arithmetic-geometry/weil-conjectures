# Bijectivity of flat compatible completion maps

for surjectivity, and faithful flatness for injectivity.

/-- Bijectivity of a completion map under the residue-field and maximal-ideal hypotheses.
Source: More on Algebra, Lemma Tag 0AGX, final rank-one argument.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-flat-local-completion-iso-bijective)

Proof:
Let R and S denote the two completions, with maximal ideals mR and nS.
The local-completion theorem identifies these ideals with those extended from A and B,
and identifies their residue fields with the residue fields of A and B. Compatibility
and hmax therefore give mR S = nS. In particular the map sends mR into nS, hence
sends every power into the corresponding power and is adically continuous.
An element of R is congruent modulo mR^k to an element of A for every k. Thus
compatibility and separation of S identify this map with the componentwise completion
map, including its action on residue fields. The same argument identifies it with the
map supplied by finite_after_completion. Since hmax and hres identify B/mA B with
A/mA, that theorem makes S finite over R for this map.
The assumed flatness now makes S a finite free module over the local ring R.
Reduction modulo mR identifies S/mR S with B/mB, a one-dimensional vector space
over A/mA, by hres. A finite basis therefore has exactly one member e.
Write 1 = u e. If u belongs to mR then 1 belongs to mR S = nS, impossible in a
nonzero local ring. Thus u is a unit, so 1 itself is a basis. Every element of S is
then uniquely x times 1 for x in R, which says exactly that the ring map is bijective.
