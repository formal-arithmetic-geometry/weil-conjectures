# Smooth algebras over a field are regular

The localizations of a smooth algebra over a field at its primes are regular local rings
(`Algebra.Smooth.isRegularLocalRing_localization`): locally the algebra is étale over a polynomial
ring, and étale maps preserve regularity.

/-- The localizations of a smooth algebra `A` over a field `K` at its primes are regular local
rings: on a neighbourhood `D(x)` of `P`, `A` is étale over a polynomial ring over `K`, which is a
regular ring, and `A_P` is a localization of `A[1/x]` at a prime. -/
