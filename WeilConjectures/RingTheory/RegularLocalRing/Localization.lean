# Localizations of regular rings

A localization of a regular ring is regular.

@[expose] public section

/-- A localization `R'` of a regular ring `R` at a multiplicative subset `M` is regular: it is
Noetherian, and its localization at a prime `q` is the localization of `R` at the contraction
of `q`. (blueprint: `lem-weil-pbc-localization-of-regular-ring`) -/
