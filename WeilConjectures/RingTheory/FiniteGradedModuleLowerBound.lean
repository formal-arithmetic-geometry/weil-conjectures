/-- A finite graded module over the nonnegatively graded polynomial ring is bounded below.
Source: blueprint `lem-sc-p1-graded-resolution`, expanded graded Nakayama argument, step 1
(blueprint: lem-sc-p1-finite-graded-module-lower-bound).

Proof: use finite homogeneous generators of degrees `dᵢ` and choose a common lower bound `B`
for those finitely many integers (also if there are no generators). Expand every polynomial
coefficient into its homogeneous components. Each resulting multiple of generator `i` has
degree `dᵢ + t` for a natural number `t`, hence degree at least `B`. Its component in a degree
`j < B` is therefore zero. Additivity of the component projection proves that every element's
`j`-component is zero. Applying this to an element of the `j`-piece proves that element is zero.
