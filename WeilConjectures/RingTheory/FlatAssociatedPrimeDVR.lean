/-- The algebraic part of Stacks Project, Algebra, Tag 032Z, after establishing
Noetherianity, flatness, and reducedness of the quotient. No completion or analytic
unramifiedness is used in this part.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-flat-associated-prime-dvr)

Proof: Put B = A/pA and C = A_q. Write q = Ann(z). Properness forces z nonzero.
Lift z to a in A. Reducedness implies a is outside q, since a in q would give z^2 = 0.
The ideal pA annihilates B, so pA <= q. For b in q, ba is in pA. The image of a is
invertible in C; cancelling it gives qC = pC.

For r outside p, its image in the domain R/p is nonzero and hence regular. Flat base
change makes (R/p) tensor_R A flat over R/p, so multiplication by r on this tensor
product is injective. The canonical tensor-quotient equivalence identifies it with B.
Thus r cannot kill z, and q contracts to p.

The induced algebra R_p -> C is flat, by localization and composition of flat maps.
Transporting the equality qC = pC along the scalar towers identifies the maximal
ideal of C with the extension of the maximal ideal of R_p. Choose a uniformizer x
of the DVR R_p. Its image y in C generates the maximal ideal, and flatness preserves
its regularity.

The ring C is Noetherian and local. Krull intersection says its maximal-ideal powers
have zero intersection. For a nonzero b, choose N with b outside the Nth power. By
induction on N, either b is a unit, or b = y*c and c is outside the preceding power.
This gives b = y^n*u with u a unit. Regularity of y then shows that a product of two
nonzero elements is nonzero, giving IsDomain C. The element y is nonzero by
regularity and nontriviality. Since it generates the maximal ideal, it is irreducible.
The unit-times-power factorization criterion supplies the DVR structure. -/
