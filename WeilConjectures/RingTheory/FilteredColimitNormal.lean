# Normality along filtered colimits: the domain part and the common-stage argument

Let `R = colim_i R_i` be a filtered colimit of commutative rings and `p` a prime of `R` with
contractions `p_i`. We record the two halves of Stacks, Tag 037D separately:

- `CommRingCat.isDomain_localization_of_isColimit`: if all `(R_i)_{p_i}` are domains, then
  `R_p` is a domain;
- `CommRingCat.isIntegrallyClosed_of_isColimit_localizationAtPrimeDiagram`: any colimit of the
  diagram `i ↦ (R_i)_{p_i}` of integrally closed domains is integrally closed.

/-- **Domain part of Stacks 037D.** If `R = colim_i R_i` is a filtered colimit of commutative
rings and `p` is a prime of `R` such that the localizations `(R_i)_{p_i}` at all contracted
primes `p_i = ι_i⁻¹(p)` are domains, then `R_p` is a domain.

/-- **Integral closedness from a localization cocone.** Let `R = colim_i R_i` be a filtered
colimit of commutative rings and `p` a prime of `R`. If `d` is a colimit cocone over the diagram
`i ↦ (R_i)_{p_i}` of localizations at the contracted primes (for instance the cocone with point
`R_p`), and every `(R_i)_{p_i}` is an integrally closed domain, then the cocone point `d.pt` is
integrally closed: a monic relation and a fraction are lifted to a common stage, where integral
closedness applies.
