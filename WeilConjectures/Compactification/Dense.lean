# Dense compactifications

The construction `Rf_! = Rp_* j_!` of the exceptional direct image out of a compactification
`f = j ≫ p` is only well behaved when the open immersion `j` is *scheme-theoretically dense*.
This file names that condition on a `AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification` and combines the
two existing ingredients — the dense refinement of an arbitrary compactification
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.denseRefinement`) and Nagata's compactification theorem
(`AlgebraicGeometry.NagataCompactification`) — into an unconditional existence statement and
a chosen dense compactification.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.IsDense`: a compactification is dense if its open
  immersion is scheme-theoretically dominant;
- `AlgebraicGeometry.denseCompactification`: the chosen dense compactification of a
  separated, quasi-compact morphism locally of finite type over a quasi-compact
  quasi-separated base.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.isDense_denseRefinement`: the dense refinement of a
  compactification of a quasi-compact morphism is dense;
- `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isDense_compactification` (blueprint:
  `lemma:nagata-two-open-dense-compactifications`): a separated, quasi-compact morphism
  locally of finite type over a quasi-compact quasi-separated base admits a dense
  compactification.

/-! ### Axiom census

The existence of dense compactifications is unconditional: the check below is run by the
build, so a `sorry` reappearing anywhere beneath Nagata's compactification theorem or the
dense refinement breaks compilation rather than going unnoticed. -/
