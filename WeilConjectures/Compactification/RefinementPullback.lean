# A refinement out of a dense compactification is cartesian over the source

Let `f : X ⟶ Y` be a morphism of schemes, let `c` and `d` be compactifications of `f` and
let `r : c.Refinement d` be a refinement, so that `c.i ≫ r.hom = d.i`. If the open
immersion `c.i` is scheme-theoretically dominant, i.e. `c` is a *dense* compactification,
then `r.hom ⁻¹ (X) = X`: the square

```
X   --c.i-->  c.Z
|              |
𝟙            r.hom
v              v
X   --d.i-->  d.Z
```

is cartesian. This is the hypothesis under which the base change isomorphism for `j_!`
along a refinement is stated, and this file is what supplies instances of it.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.Refinement.isPullback_of_isSchemeTheoreticallyDominant`:
  the square above is cartesian for a refinement out of a dense compactification;
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.Refinement.isPullback_denseRefinement`: the
  specialisation to the dense refinement `c.denseRefinement` of an arbitrary
  compactification `c`, whose open immersion is scheme-theoretically dominant;
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.Refinement.isPullback_comp`: cartesianness of these
  squares pastes along a composite of refinements.

The proof compares `X` with the pullback `P := c.Z ×[d.Z] X` of `r.hom` along `d.i`. The
canonical morphism `t : X ⟶ P` is a section of the projection `P ⟶ X`, which is proper,
being a base change of the proper morphism `r.hom`; a section of a separated morphism is a
closed immersion, so `t` is a closed immersion. On the other hand `t` composed with the
projection `P ⟶ c.Z` is `c.i`, which is scheme-theoretically dominant, and `P ⟶ c.Z` is a
flat monomorphism, being a base change of the open immersion `d.i`; so `t` is
scheme-theoretically dominant as well. A closed immersion with trivial kernel is an
isomorphism, and that is exactly the assertion that the square is cartesian.

/-- **A refinement out of a dense compactification is cartesian over the source**: if the
open immersion `c.i` of the compactification `c` is scheme-theoretically dominant and
quasi-compact, then the inverse image of `X` under the ambient morphism of a refinement
`r : c.Refinement d` is again `X`. (blueprint: `BA43-DENSE-DATA`)

This is phrased with the density and quasi-compactness of `c.i` as instance binders, as in
`AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.Refinement.instSubsingleton`: neither is findable by
typeclass search from `c` alone, but with them in scope the hypothesis of the base change
isomorphism for `j_!` along `r` is discharged automatically. Quasi-compactness of `c.i` is
equivalent to quasi-compactness of `f`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.quasiCompact_openImmersion_iff`), which the blueprint
assumes throughout this chapter, `f` being finitely presented there. -/

/-- The dense refinement of a compactification of a quasi-compact morphism satisfies both
instance hypotheses of
`AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.Refinement.isPullback_of_isSchemeTheoreticallyDominant`

hence scheme-theoretically dominant, and it is quasi-compact because `f` is. -/

/-! ### Axiom census

Cartesianness of a refinement out of a dense compactification is unconditional: the check
below is run by the build, so a `sorry` reappearing anywhere beneath it breaks compilation
rather than going unnoticed. -/
