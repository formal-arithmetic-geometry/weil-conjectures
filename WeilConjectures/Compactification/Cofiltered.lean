# The category of compactifications is cofiltered

The compactifications of a fixed morphism `f : X ⟶ Y` form a category
`AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.category`, with the refinements of
`WeilConjectures.Compactification.Refinement` as morphisms. This file shows that this
category is cofiltered as soon as `f` is quasi-compact and admits a compactification.

Both halves come from the *dense* common refinement
`AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.exists_common_refinement_isSchemeTheoreticallyDominant`,
which refines two given compactifications by one in which `X` is scheme-theoretically
dense:

- any two compactifications are refined by a common one, which is the cone on two objects;
- any two parallel refinements `r s : c ⟶ d` are equalized by a further refinement. No
  equalizer subscheme has to be built for this: a refinement out of a scheme-theoretically
  dense compactification is unique (`Refinement.ext_of_isSchemeTheoreticallyDominant`), so
  for a dense `e` refining `c` by `h : e ⟶ c` the two composites `h ≫ r` and `h ≫ s` are
  refinements of `d` by `e`, hence literally equal.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.isCofilteredOrEmpty`: the category of
  compactifications of a quasi-compact morphism is cofiltered or empty;
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Compactification.isCofiltered`: it is cofiltered as soon as a
  compactification exists.

/-- Blueprint `sk-prop-nagata-sketch-comp-category`: The compactification category and

For a quasi-compact `f : X ⟶ Y`, the category of compactifications of `f` is cofiltered or
empty: any two compactifications `c` and `d` admit a common refinement `e`, and any two
parallel refinements `r s : c ⟶ d` are equalized by a further refinement `h : e ⟶ c`.

For a quasi-compact `f : X ⟶ Y` admitting a compactification, the category of

/-! ### Axiom census

Cofilteredness of the category of compactifications is unconditional: the check below is run
by the build, so a `sorry` reappearing anywhere beneath it breaks compilation rather than
going unnoticed. -/
