# Mixed weight bounds for constructible Weil sheaves and complexes

This file sets up the language in which the Deligne–Laumon reduction to the affine line
(blueprint section `sec-deligne-laumon-general`) is stated. A constructible Weil sheaf is
`ι`-*mixed of weights at most* `w` if it admits a finite filtration whose successive quotients
are punctually `ι`-pure of some weight at most `w`, and a bounded constructible Weil complex `K`
is mixed of weights at most `w` if `𝓗ᵇK` is mixed of weights at most `w + b` for every `b`.

## Conventions

The `ℓ`-adic formalism these statements are phrased against is the provisional interface of
`WeilConjectures.WeilSheaf.Defs`: the abelian categories `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf k₀ l X` of
constructible Weil `ℚ̄_ℓ`-sheaves on a `k₀`-scheme `X`, their bounded derived categories
`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilComplex k₀ l X`, lissity, the geometric stalks with their local
Frobenius, the punctual weight conditions
`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.IsPunctuallyPureOfWeight` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.HasWeightsAtMost`, the reality condition
`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.IsReal`, and the direct images with compact support
`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.higherLowerShriek` (`Rʳf₀!`) and
`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilComplex.derivedLowerShriek` (`Rf₀!`). The notions that other blueprint
blocks own are opaque placeholders there, each tagged `TODO(unify)` with the node that owns it;
what this block owns is the mixed upper bounds defined below.

Cohomological indexing is used throughout: `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilComplex.homologySheaf b` is
the `b`-th *cohomology* sheaf `𝓗ᵇK`, as in `DerivedCategory.homologyFunctor`, so the bound for
a complex of weights at most `w` is `w + b` in degree `b`, Deligne's convention.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.IsMixedOfWeightsAtMost` and
  `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilComplex.IsMixedOfWeightsAtMost`: mixed of weights at most `w`, for a
  sheaf and for a complex.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.IsMixed`: mixed, that is, mixed of weights at most `w` for some
  `w`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.HasDirectImageWeightBound`: the direct-image weight assertion for a single
  morphism, the statement the reductions of `sec-deligne-laumon-general` propagate, and its
  complex form `AlgebraicGeometry.HasDirectImageComplexWeightBound`.

Monotonicity in the bound and the bound for a zero sheaf are proved
(`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.IsMixedOfWeightsAtMost.mono_weight` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.isMixedOfWeightsAtMost_of_isZero`), and the closure properties the
blueprint records alongside the definition — under subobjects, quotients and extensions — are
proved: `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.IsMixedOfWeightsAtMost.of_mono`, `.of_epi` and
`.of_mono_cokernel`. They come from the general closure properties of objects with a finite
filtration (`CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.filtrationClosure`), applied to the property
`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.isPunctuallyPureOfWeightLE` of being punctually pure of some weight
at most `w`, which is closed under subobjects and quotients since the stalk functors are exact
(`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.IsPunctuallyPureOfWeight.of_mono`). From them, the middle term
of an exact sequence whose outer terms are mixed of weights at most `w` is mixed of weights at
most `w`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.IsMixedOfWeightsAtMost.of_exact`), and so is a sheaf with a finite
filtration whose successive quotients are
(`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.IsMixedOfWeightsAtMost.of_filtration`).

A mixed sheaf whose local Frobenius eigenvalues are bounded by `q_y ^ (v / 2)` is mixed of
weights at most `v` (`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.IsMixedOfWeightsAtMost.of_hasWeightsAtMost`,
blueprint `lem-zl-mixed-punctual-cutoff`), and a constant twist shifts mixed weight bounds
(`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.IsMixedOfWeightsAtMost.constantTwist`).

/-- **Passage from sheaves to complexes.** Let `Φ` be a triangulated functor between Weil
complexes which carries every Weil sheaf mixed of weights at most `v`, placed in degree zero, to a
Weil complex mixed of weights at most `v`, for every `v`. Then `Φ` carries every Weil complex
mixed of weights at most `w` to a Weil complex mixed of weights at most `w`: by induction on the
length of a bounded complex `K`, using the truncation triangle `τ_{<b}K ⟶ K ⟶ 𝓗ᵇ(K)[-b] ⟶`
and the extension stability of complex weights. This is the output of the hypercohomology
spectral sequence `E₂^{a,b} = 𝓗ᵃ(Φ 𝓗ᵇ(K)) ⇒ 𝓗ᵃ⁺ᵇ(Φ K)` used in the blueprint
(blueprint: `lem-zl-sheaves-to-complexes`). -/
