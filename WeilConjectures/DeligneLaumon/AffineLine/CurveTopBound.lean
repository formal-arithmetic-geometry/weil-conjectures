# The top compactly supported cohomology of a lisse sheaf on a smooth affine curve

If `C₀` is a smooth affine curve and `G` is a lisse Weil sheaf on `C₀`, punctually `ι`-pure of
weight `w`, then `H_c^2(C, G)` has weights at most `w + 2` (blueprint `lem-a1-curve-hc2-bound`).
For geometrically connected `C₀` this is the coinvariant description of `H_c^2`; in general it
follows from the purity of `H_c^2` on a smooth affine curve which need not be geometrically
connected (`AlgebraicGeometry.isPureOfWeightOver_compactlySupportedCohomology_two_of_isAffine`),
after a constant twist.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.hasWeightsAtMostOver_compactlySupportedCohomology_two`: the top
  compactly supported cohomology of a pure lisse sheaf on a smooth affine curve has weights at
  most `w + 2`.

the constant twist `G ⊗ 𝓑_b` is punctually pure of weight `0`, so its `H_c^2` is pure of weight

/-- The case of `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.hasWeightsAtMostOver_compactlySupportedCohomology_two`
of a smooth affine curve which is not geometrically connected: then `H_c^2(C, G)` still has
weights at most `w + 2`.

The blueprint proof splits `C₀` into its connected components, and a connected component with
field of constants `k₁ = 𝔽_{q^d}` into the `d` geometrically connected curves over `k₁` which make
up its geometric fibre, permuted cyclically by the Frobenius. Weil sheaves over a finite extension
`k₁` of `k₀` are not available, so we use instead the purity of `H_c^2` of a sheaf punctually pure
of weight zero on a smooth affine curve, not necessarily geometrically connected (blueprint
`lem-zl-affine-curve-hc2-purity`), after a constant twist normalizing the weight to zero
(`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.isPureOfWeightOver_compactlySupportedCohomology_two_of_norm_eq`).
If `G` has no local Frobenius eigenvalue at all, it is punctually pure of the weights `0` and
`-2` at once, so `H_c^2(C, G)` is pure of the weights `2` and `0` at once and has no Frobenius
eigenvalue. -/

/-- *Top compact-support bound on a curve.* If `C₀` is a smooth affine curve and `G` is a lisse
Weil sheaf on `C₀`, punctually `ι`-pure of weight `w`, then `H_c^2(C, G)` has weights at most
`w + 2`. For `C₀` geometrically connected, `H_c^2(C, G)` is the Tate twist `(-1)` of the geometric
coinvariants of `G`, which are pure of weight `w`, so it is pure of weight `w + 2`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilSheaf.isPureOfWeightOver_compactlySupportedCohomology_two`); the general
case reduces to this one over the fields of constants of the connected components.
