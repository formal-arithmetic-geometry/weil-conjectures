# The derived pushforwards and the derived tensor product are triangulated

The derived functors on the unbounded derived categories of étale sheaves are triangulated, for
the commutations with shifts of `WeilConjectures.SixFunctors.Etale.Derived.Shift`:

* `Rg_*` is right adjoint to the triangulated functor `D(g^*)` induced by the exact pullback,
  and its commutation with shifts is the one induced by the adjunction, so it is triangulated
  by `Adjunction.isTriangulated_rightAdjoint`;
* `Rf_! = D(i_!) ⋙ Rg_*` for the chosen compactification `(i, g)` is a composite of two
  triangulated functors;
* `- ⊗ᴸ K` is the tensor product of the monoidal derived category, which is triangulated in
  its first variable (`DerivedCategory.isTriangulated_tensorRight`).
