# Derived Upper Shriek

The exceptional inverse image `Rf^!` along a morphism `f : X ⟶ Y` admitting a compactification
is *constructed* here out of the two halves of the derived lower shriek
`Rf_! = Di_! ⋙ Rg_*` attached to a compactification `c = (X ⟶[i] Z ⟶[g] Y)` of `f`:

`Rf^! := Rg^! ⋙ Di^*`,

where `Rg^!` is a chosen right adjoint of the derived pushforward `Rg_*` along the *proper*
morphism `g`, and `Di^*` is the levelwise pullback along the open immersion `i`, which is right
adjoint to `Di_!` by `Etale.derivedOpenImmersionLowerShriekUpperStarAdjunction`. The
adjunction `Rf_! ⊣ Rf^!` is then the composite of these two adjunctions. The only input taken
for granted is that `Rg_*` is a left adjoint for proper `g`; it is *not* assumed that `Rf_!`
is a left adjoint for a general `f`, that is a theorem here.

`Rf^!` is only defined on the unbounded derived categories: it does not preserve bounded
below objects in general, so it does not restrict to `D⁺`.

# Main Results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.isLeftAdjoint_rightDerivedLowerStar_of_isProper` : for `g` proper,
  `Rg_*` is a left adjoint on `D(Z_ét)`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.rightDerivedUpperShriekOfCompactification` : `Rf^!` with respect to
  a compactification `c`, with scoped notation `Rf^!(c)[A]`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.rightDerivedUpperShriekOfCompactificationAdjunction` : the
  adjunction `Rf_!(c)[A] ⊣ Rf^!(c)[A]`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.rightDerivedUpperShriek` : `Rf^! : D(Y_ét) ⥤ D(X_ét)` for the
  chosen compactification, with scoped notation `R(f)^![A]`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.rightDerivedUpperShriekAdjunction` : the adjunction `Rf_! ⊣ Rf^!`
  on the unbounded derived categories.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.isLeftAdjoint_rightDerivedLowerShriek` : `Rf_!` is a left adjoint
  on `D(X_ét)`, a consequence of the previous item.

## Implementation notes

* `isLeftAdjoint_rightDerivedLowerStar_of_isProper` is `sorry` by design: this file only
  *states* that `Rg_*` has a right adjoint for `g` proper, the proof is left to a later file.
  The adjoint exists by Brown representability, `Rg_*` being, for `g` proper, a colimit
  preserving functor between compactly generated triangulated categories.
* `Rg^!` for proper `g` is `Functor.rightAdjoint`, i.e. an arbitrary choice of right adjoint
  extracted from the instance, not a construction. Only the adjunction
  `Adjunction.ofIsLeftAdjoint` should be used about it. The composite `Rf^!` is a construction
  out of it and `Di^*`.
* The derived adjunction `Di_! ⊣ Di^*` goes through the total left derived functor of `i_!`,
  which is why the K-flat hypotheses on the coefficient category `A` of
  `WeilConjectures.SixFunctors.Etale.Derived.OpenImmersionLowerShriek` are needed for the
  adjunctions of this file, though not for the definition of `Rf^!` itself.
* There is no underived `f^!`, but the notation still carries the `R` of `R(f)_![A]` and
  `R((g)_*[A])`, to mark that it lives on derived categories rather than on sheaves.

## TODO

* The composition `R(f ≫ g)^! ≅ R(g)^! ⋙ R(f)^!`, from the corresponding compatibility
  of `Rf_!`.
* For `f` étale, `Rf^! = f^*`; for `f` proper, `Rf^!` is right adjoint to `Rf_*`.
