# Derived pullback along an étale morphism commutes with the derived internal hom

For an étale morphism `u : U ⟶ X` and finite coefficients `Λ`, the comparison
`Lu^* RHom(M, N) ⟶ RHom(Lu^* M, Lu^* N)` of the monoidal functor `Lu^*` is an isomorphism
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.isIso_ihomComparison_leftDerivedUpperStar_of_etale`, blueprint
`def-weil-derived-pullback-tensor-hom`). It is conjugate to the projection map of the derived
adjunction `D(u_!) ⊣ Lu^*`, which is an isomorphism by the derived projection formula for étale
morphisms (`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.isIso_projectionMap_derivedEtaleLowerShriek`).

/-- Blueprint `def-weil-derived-pullback-tensor-hom`: Derived pullback, tensor product, and
internal Hom.

For an étale morphism `u : U ⟶ X`, the derived pullback commutes with the derived internal hom:
the comparison `Lu^* RHom(M, N) ⟶ RHom(Lu^* M, Lu^* N)` of the monoidal functor `Lu^*`
(`CategoryTheory.Functor.LaxMonoidal.ihomComparison`) is an isomorphism. The pullback along `u`
is the restriction to the slice site `X_ét/U`, which has an exact left adjoint `u_!`; the
comparison is conjugate to the projection map `u_!(Lu^*M ⊗ᴸ T) ⟶ M ⊗ᴸ u_!T` of the derived
adjunction `D(u_!) ⊣ Lu^*`, an isomorphism by the derived projection formula
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.isIso_projectionMap_derivedEtaleLowerShriek`). -/
