# Extensions of perfect fields are separable; perfect closures in an algebraic closure

* `Algebra.isSeparableExtension_of_perfectField`: every field extension of a perfect field is
  separable in the sense of `Algebra.IsSeparableExtension` (Stacks 030W).
* `perfectClosure_subset_perfectClosure_algebraicClosure`: for `K ⊆ L` and
  `Ω := AlgebraicClosure L`, the perfect closure of `K` in `Ω` is contained in the perfect
  closure of `L` in `Ω`; `perfectClosureAlgebraicClosureHom` is the resulting `K`-algebra map.
