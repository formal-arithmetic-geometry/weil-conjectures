# Kernel transforms

Let `π : V ⟶ S` and `π' : V' ⟶ S` be two `S`-schemes and let `𝒦` be a complex on
`V ×_S V'`, the *kernel*. The *kernel transform* (or integral transform) attached to `𝒦` and
a shift `a : ℤ` is

`Φ_𝒦(K) = Rp₂,!(p₁^* K ⊗ᴸ 𝒦)[a]`,

`p₁, p₂` being the two projections of `V ×_S V'`. Kernel transforms compose: the composite
of the kernel transforms of `𝒦` and `𝒦'` is the kernel transform of the convolution
`𝒦' ∗ 𝒦`, with the shifts added. The Fourier–Deligne transform of
`WeilConjectures.FourierTransform.Defs` is the kernel transform of the Fourier kernel.

The constructions are made for any coefficient category `A` on which the étale six functors
are built: a Grothendieck abelian, closed symmetric monoidal category with functorial flat
resolutions.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.kernelTransform`: the kernel transform `Φ_𝒦` with shift `a`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.kernelConvolution`: the convolution
  `𝒦' ∗ 𝒦 = r₁₃,!(r₁₂^* 𝒦 ⊗ᴸ r₂₃^* 𝒦')`.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.nonempty_iso_kernelTransform_shift`: shifting the kernel shifts the
  kernel transform.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.nonempty_iso_kernelTransform_comp`: composition of kernel
  transforms.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.nonempty_iso_kernelTransform_diagonal`: the kernel transform of a
  kernel supported on the diagonal is a tensor product.

## Implementation notes

The statements only assert that an isomorphism *exists*. Showing that the composition of
kernel transforms is compatible with the associativity of convolution will need specific,
coherent isomorphisms, which `Classical.choice` cannot provide.

`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.nonempty_iso_kernelTransform_comp` is proved on the triple product by
compact-support base change along the cartesian square with sides `r₁₂`, `r₂₃`, `p₂` and
`q₁`, then the projection formula for `r₂₃` and `r₁₃` and the composition law of `Rf_!`. The
maps `p₂`, `q₂` and `r₁₃` are base changes of `π`, `π'` and `π'` respectively (`r₁₃` along
`V ×_S V'' ⟶ S`), so the finiteness hypotheses are put on `π` and `π'`: instance search does
not derive them for `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.tripleProj₁₃`. The statement is over the
whole unbounded derived categories, while the project's projection formula
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.nonempty_iso_derivedTensor_rightDerivedLowerShriek` only covers a
bounded constructible complex and a complex of finite Tor amplitude. The unbounded form holds
for finite `Λ`: the projection map is an isomorphism for `j_!` of an open immersion formally,
and for a proper morphism because its direct image then has finite cohomological dimension.
That argument does not use the exponent of `Λ`, and the classical projection formula for
`Rf_!` holds for all torsion coefficients (SGA 4 XVII 5.2.9); `[HasInvertibleExponent Λ S]` is
inherited from the project's projection formula.

`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.nonempty_iso_kernelTransform_diagonal` is the projection formula for
the closed immersion `Δ`, followed by `Δ_* = Δ_!` and `Δ ≫ p₂ = 𝟙`. Since `R(f)_!` is computed
with a chosen compactification, the last two steps use independence of the compactification
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.rightDerivedLowerShriekIso`), which needs `π` quasi-compact and
torsion coefficients.

TODO: prove `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.nonempty_iso_kernelTransform_shift`. It is formal once the
shift isomorphism of the derived tensor product in its second variable is natural in the first,
`derivedTensorRight A X (𝒦⟦a⟧) ≅ derivedTensorRight A X 𝒦 ⋙ shiftFunctor _ a`. The instances
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.commShiftDerivedTensorObj` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.commShiftDerivedTensorFlipObj`, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.derivedTensorShiftIso` built from them, only give naturality in the
shifted variable.

TODO: upgrade the statements back to `Iso` constructions once they can be built.
