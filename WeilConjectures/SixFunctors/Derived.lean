# Derived pushforward and derived lower shriek on unbounded derived categories

For an abelian coefficient category `A` admitting sheafification on the small étale sites,
the categories of `A`-valued étale sheaves are abelian, the pushforward
`g_* = Etale.lowerStar` along an arbitrary morphism `g` and the lower shriek
`f_! = Etale.lowerShriek` along a morphism `f` admitting a compactification are additive,
and this file records their total right derived functors
`Rg_* : D(Z_ét) ⥤ D(Y_ét)` and `Rf_! : D(X_ét) ⥤ D(Y_ét)` on the unbounded
derived categories, implemented via `CategoryTheory.Functor.rightDerivedFunctor`.

The chosen localized categories `HasDerivedCategory` are inputs with a general universe.
The construction of the unbounded right derived functor requires the source abelian
category to have K-injective resolutions (`CategoryTheory.Abelian.HasKInjectiveResolutions`).
The sheaf categories are Grothendieck abelian
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.isGrothendieckAbelian_sheaf_smallEtaleTopology`) whenever the
coefficient category `A` is a concrete Grothendieck abelian category (with hom types and
underlying types in the universe `u` of the base schemes, and the forgetful functor
preserving limits and filtered colimits and reflecting isomorphisms); this covers the
intended applications `A = Ab.{u}` and `A = ModuleCat.{u} Λ`. That Grothendieck abelian
categories have K-injective resolutions is a theorem of Alonso Tarrío–Jeremías
López–Souto Salorio and Serpé; it is recorded here as the sorried instance
`CategoryTheory.Abelian.hasKInjectiveResolutions_of_isGrothendieckAbelian`.

Because of that `sorry`, the definitions in this file are **not** unconditional: `#print
axioms AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.rightDerivedLowerStar` reports `sorryAx`. Code that only
needs bounded below complexes should therefore prefer the counterparts in
`WeilConjectures.SixFunctors.DerivedPlus`, which construct `R⁺g_*` and `R⁺f_!` on the
bounded below derived categories out of enough injectives alone and are free of `sorryAx`.
That covers the intended application, where the target is `D^b_c`. The two constructions
agree where both apply, by
`CategoryTheory.Functor.rightDerivedFunctorPlusCompatibility`. This file remains the right
long-term home: the sorried instance is a placeholder for a true theorem, and once it is
proved — most naturally upstream in Mathlib — the unbounded functors become unconditional
too.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.rightDerivedLowerStar`: the total right derived functor
  `Rg_*` of the pushforward on unbounded derived categories of étale sheaves.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.rightDerivedLowerShriek`: the total right derived functor
  `Rf_!` of the lower shriek on unbounded derived categories of étale sheaves.
