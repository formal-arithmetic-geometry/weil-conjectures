/-! # Resolution-normalized sequence-site adjoints

Source: blueprint main-20261015, `sec-six-functors/sk-thm-sf-package/`
`fix-prop-coherence.proof.md`, coefficient-comparison sentence; Stacks 0940,
0941, 03D7, 06YY, 07A6 and 0D6E
(blueprint: def-sf-sequence-adjoint-shift-interfaces).

The constructions of this node are the published declarations of
`WeilConjectures.SixFunctors.Supporting.PurSequenceAdjointResolutionShifts`, reexported here unchanged:
`purSequenceShiftedReplacement` (the ordinary shift comparison followed by the shifted given
replacement map), the left and right shift models `PurSequenceLeftShiftModels` and
`PurSequenceRightShiftModels` (coherent integer shifts, reduction and total-limit comparison
squares, shifted quasi-isomorphism and signed degreewise equations), the predicates
`purSequenceRightResolutionCompatibility` and `purSequenceShiftedDegreeCompatibility`, and the
record `PurSequenceAdjointShifts` with the shift compatibility of the same unit and counit.
They are not redeclared, so that one definition per notion is kept.
