/-- The strict reduction comparison supplied by the strict pullback construction
has the simultaneous representative normalization square. The finite projections
are the prescribed scalar tensor maps on every flat-term K-flat pair.
The comparison is asserted to exist, not quantified over: an arbitrary comparison
need not be normalized (its negative has the same type but not the square).
