# Points of a scheme lie on an open or on its closed complement

Let `j : U ⟶ X` be an open immersion and `i : Z ⟶ X` a closed immersion whose range is the
complement of the range of `j`. This file shows that a point of `X` with values in a field
factors through `j` or through `i`, as an actual factorization of morphisms of schemes and not
merely as a statement about images.

This is the geometric input to the joint conservativity of `j^*` and `i^*` on the small étale
site: a geometric point of `X` is a point with values in a separably closed field, and joint
conservativity is proved by evaluating at such points, each of which lives on `U` or on `Z`.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.existsUnique_fac_or_fac_of_range_eq_compl` — a morphism from the spectrum
  of a field to `X` factors uniquely through `j` or uniquely through `i`
  (blueprint: `lemma:openclosed-point-factors`).
- `AlgebraicGeometry.disjoint_range_of_range_eq_compl` — the two ranges of a complementary
  pair are disjoint. This is the half of the complementarity condition that the formal part
  of the argument uses.

/-- A point of `X` with values in a field `K` lies either on the open `U` or on its closed
complement `Z`, as a factorization of morphisms of schemes: any `s : Spec K ⟶ X` is either of
the form `t ≫ j` for a unique `t : Spec K ⟶ U`, or of the form `t ≫ i` for a unique
`t : Spec K ⟶ Z`.

The open half is `AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.lift`, unique because an open immersion is
a monomorphism; the closed half is
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsClosedImmersion.existsUnique_fac_of_field`. What carries the closed half
is `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IdealSheafData.le_ker_iff_range_subset_support`, whose hypothesis
on the source is `IsReduced (Spec K)`; the field hypothesis is used beyond that only for
`Subsingleton (Spec K)`, which upgrades "the closed point of `Spec K` lands in the range of
`i`" to "the whole range of `s` lands in the range of `i`".
