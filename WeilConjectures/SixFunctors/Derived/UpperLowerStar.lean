`Functor.rightDerivedFunctorPlus` needs only `EnoughInjectives` on the source, which
Mathlib provides for every Grothendieck abelian category. The only dependence on the

through the chosen `HasDerivedCategory.{u}` instance. -/

## The derived pullback `Lg^*`

The pullback `g^* = Etale.upperStar` is left derived using the K-flat left
derivability structure of `WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.DerivedCategory.LeftDerivedFunctor.Defs`.
This requires the source sheaf category `Sheaf Y.smallEtaleTopology A` to carry a
preadditive monoidal structure whose tensor product interacts well with coproducts and
`ℤ`-indexed colimits, and to admit functorial flat resolutions. These inputs are stated
as hypotheses on the coefficient category `A` only; they are transported to the sheaf
categories by the instances of the folder
`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.GrothendieckAbelian`, with the monoidal structure and
its compatibilities provided by its `Monoidal` subfolder.

The additivity and right exactness of `g^*` are derived here from the adjunction
`g^* ⊣ g_*`; the left exactness comes from `Etale.preservesFiniteLimits_upperStar`, whose
hypotheses — sheafification on the small étale site of `Z` and left exactness of the left
Kan extension along the opposite of base change — are stated as variables of this section;
for an étale `g` both are automatic. Since `g^*` is exact, it preserves in
particular all K-flat quasi-isomorphisms, which is the input needed by the
derivability-structure machinery.

/- The preadditive monoidal structure on the coefficient category. It is assumed closed
and braided (as is the intended application `A = ModuleCat.{u + 1} Λ` for a commutative
ring `Λ`, which is even symmetric monoidal closed): that is what makes the class of
sheafification-inverting morphisms of presheaves monoidal, hence what lets the monoidal
structure descend to the étale sheaf categories, see

/-- The total left derived functor `Lg^* : D(Y_ét) ⥤ D(Z_ét)` of the pullback `g^*`
along an arbitrary morphism `g : Z ⟶ Y` on the unbounded derived categories of étale
sheaves, defined via the K-flat left derivability structure: `Lg^*` is computed by
applying `g^*` to a K-flat resolution.

Since `g^*` is exact, the counit `Lg^* ∘ Q ⟶ Q ∘ g^*` is in fact an isomorphism
everywhere; the construction via the derivability structure is uniform in the functor
and applies verbatim once `g^*` is replaced by a non-exact functor (e.g. the pullback
of sheaves of modules over a varying sheaf of rings). -/
