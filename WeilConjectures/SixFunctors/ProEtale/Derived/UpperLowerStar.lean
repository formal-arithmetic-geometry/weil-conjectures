# Derived Upper Star and Lower Star

This is the pro-étale counterpart of
`WeilConjectures.SixFunctors.Etale.Derived.UpperLowerStar`.

As there, the derived pullback and pushforward of pro-étale sheaves are *not* given
definitions of their own: they are the generic derived-functor constructions of the folder
`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.DerivedCategory` applied to the underived pullback
`(g)^*[A]` and pushforward `(g)_*[A]`, and they are written by nesting the generic
notations inside the underived ones:

| derived functor | notation | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Rg_* : D(Z_proét) ⥤ D(Y_proét)` | `R((g)_*[A])` | `(g)_*[A].rightDerivedFunctor` |
| `Rg_* : D⁺(Z_proét) ⥤ D⁺(Y_proét)` | `R+((g)_*[A])` | `(g)_*[A].rightDerivedFunctorPlus` |
| `Lg^* : D(Y_proét) ⥤ D(Z_proét)` | `L((g)^*[A])` | `(g)^*[A].leftDerivedFunctor` |
| `g^* : D(Y_proét) ⥤ D(Z_proét)` | `D((g)^*[A])` | `(g)^*[A].mapDerivedCategory` |
| `g^* : D⁺(Y_proét) ⥤ D⁺(Z_proét)` | `D+((g)^*[A])` | `(g)^*[A].mapDerivedCategoryPlus` |

The generic notations `R(-)`, `R+(-)`, `L(-)`, `D(-)` and `D+(-)` are scoped in the
`CategoryTheory.Functor` namespace, so a file using them needs
`open scoped CategoryTheory.Functor`. Each row above is recorded below as an `example`,
at the place where a definition of the corresponding functor would have stood, so that
the type of the functor is spelled out.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.leftDerivedUpperStarIsoMapDerivedCategory` : the derived
  pullback `L((g)^*[A])` is the functor `D((g)^*[A])` induced levelwise by the exact
  functor `g^*`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.leftDerivedUpperStarComp` : the composition isomorphism
  `L(g₁ ≫ g₂)^* ≅ Lg₂^* ⋙ Lg₁^*`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.leftDerivedUpperStarId` : the identity isomorphism
  `L(𝟙 X)^* ≅ 𝟭` of the derived pullback.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.leftDerivedUpperStarCongr` : the transport `Lf^* ≅ Lg^*`
  along an equality `f = g`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.leftDerivedUpperStarHomologyFunctorIso` : the derived
  pullback commutes with the homology functors, `H^n ⋙ g^* ≅ Lg^* ⋙ H^n`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.singleFunctorCompLeftDerivedUpperStarIso` : the derived
  pullback of a sheaf placed in degree `0` is the pullback of the sheaf placed in degree
  `0`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.derivedUpperStarLowerStarAdjunction` and
  `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.derivedUpperStarLowerStarAdjunctionPlus` : the derived
  adjunctions `L((g)^*[A]) ⊣ R((g)_*[A])` and `D+((g)^*[A]) ⊣ R+((g)_*[A])`.

- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.derivedBaseChangeMap` : the derived base change map
  `Lg^* Rf_* ⟶ Rf'_* Lg'^*` of a commutative square, the mate of the isomorphism
  `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.leftDerivedUpperStarSquareIso : Lf'^* Lg^* ≅ Lg'^* Lf^*`.

## The derived pullback `Lg^*`

The pullback `g^* = ProEtale.upperStar` is left derived using the K-flat left
derivability structure of `WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.DerivedCategory.LeftDerivedFunctor.Defs`.
This requires the source sheaf category `Sheaf (Scheme.ProEt.topology Y) A` to carry a
preadditive monoidal structure whose tensor product preserves colimits, to have countable
coproducts and exact `ℤ`-indexed colimits, and to admit functorial flat resolutions.
These inputs are stated as hypotheses on the coefficient category `A` only; they are
supplied for the sheaf categories by the instances of the folder
`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.GrothendieckAbelian`, with the monoidal structure and its
compatibility with colimits provided by its `Monoidal` subfolder, and its preadditivity
by `CategoryTheory.Sheaf.monoidalPreadditive`, which holds for any sheaf category.

As in the étale case one of those instances is still `sorry`ed, so everything below
depends on it: `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.hasFunctorialFlatResolution_sheaf` (functorial
flat resolutions of pro-étale sheaves), discussed in the module docstring of the file that
states it. The tensor-colimit input is no longer among them: it is now proved, by Day's
reflection theorem, in
`AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.preservesColimitsOfSize_tensorLeft_sheaf`.

The additivity and exactness of `g^*` are `ProEtale.additive_upperStar`,
`ProEtale.preservesFiniteLimits_upperStar` and `ProEtale.preservesHomology_upperStar` of
`WeilConjectures.SixFunctors.ProEtale.UpperLowerStar.Defs`; the left exactness there rests
on the sorried `HasSheafify` instance for the small pro-étale site of `Z` and on left
exactness of the left Kan extension along the opposite of base change, both global
instances of the folder `WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.GrothendieckAbelian` (for a weakly
étale `g` the latter is proved, not sorried). Since `g^*` is exact, it preserves in
particular all K-flat quasi-isomorphisms, which is the input needed by the
derivability-structure machinery.

/- The preadditive monoidal structure on the coefficient category. It is assumed closed

morphisms of presheaves monoidal, hence what lets the monoidal structure descend to the
pro-étale sheaf categories, see
`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.GrothendieckAbelian.Monoidal.Defs`. Closedness and the
symmetry moreover make the pro-étale sheaf categories monoidal closed by Day's reflection
theorem, hence make tensoring by a fixed sheaf preserve colimits, which is what the
tensor product of complexes needs, see

along an arbitrary morphism `g : Z ⟶ Y` on the unbounded derived categories of pro-étale

applying `g^*` to a K-flat resolution.

It is not a definition of its own: it is the generic `Functor.leftDerivedFunctor`,

Since `g^*` is exact, the counit `Lg^* ∘ Q ⟶ Q ∘ g^*` is in fact an isomorphism
everywhere; the construction via the derivability structure is uniform in the functor
and applies verbatim once `g^*` is replaced by a non-exact functor (e.g. the pullback
of sheaves of modules over a varying sheaf of rings). -/

## The derived adjunction `Lg^* ⊣ Rg_*`

The adjunction `g^* ⊣ g_*` between the pullback and the pushforward of pro-étale sheaves
induces an adjunction `Lg^* ⊣ Rg_*` between their total derived functors on the
unbounded derived categories, by
`CategoryTheory.Adjunction.derivedAdjunction`
(`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.DerivedCategory.Adjunction`): the left adjoint is
derived via the K-flat left derivability structure on `D(Y_proét)` and the right adjoint
via the K-injective right derivability structure on `D(Z_proét)`, and the two
"absoluteness" hypotheses of mathlib's abstract theorem `Adjunction.derived` hold
because the derived-functor comparison maps are isomorphisms on K-flat, respectively
K-injective, complexes.

The hypotheses of this section are those of the section `DerivedUpperStar`: the
K-injective resolutions on the pushforward side are supplied by the sheaf category
being Grothendieck abelian.
