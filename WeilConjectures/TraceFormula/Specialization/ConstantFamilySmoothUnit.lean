# The specialization unit of the constant family of a smooth scheme

Let `Y` be a smooth separated `k`-scheme of finite type and `Y × S` its constant family over the
trait `S = Spec k'⟦t⟧`, the deformation of the zero ideal of `Y`
(`ProEtale.CondensedRing.deformationModel Y ⊥ k'`). The structure morphism `Y ⟶ Spec k` induces a
morphism of deformation models `Y × S ⟶ S × Spec k = 𝒟_⊥ (Spec k)` whose morphism of total spaces
is smooth, being a base change of `Y ⟶ Spec k`. By the smooth exchange of nearby cycles its
pullback exchange is invertible at the unit, and the specialization unit of the constant family of
the point is invertible; so the specialization unit `σ_Y : Λ ⟶ Ψ_{Y × S}(Λ)` is an isomorphism.
This is the case `L = Λ` of blueprint `lemma-nearby-cycles-constant-family` for smooth `Y`.

## Main results

- `ProEtale.CondensedRing.isIso_deformationModel_bot_unit_of_smooth`: for `ℚ̄_ℓ`-coefficients.
- `ProEtale.CondensedRing.isIso_deformationModel_bot_unit_of_smooth_finiteCoefficient`: for
  coefficients in a finite ring `T` killed by a power of a prime `ℓ ≠ char k'`.
