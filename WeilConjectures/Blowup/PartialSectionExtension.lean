# Extending a partial section after an admissible blow-up

This file proves **Conrad's Theorem 2.4** in the reduced form in which it is used on the
Conrad/Zariski's-Main-Theorem route to elimination of indeterminacy (Stacks Project Tag
081S), together with the special case recorded as Conrad's Remark 2.5.

Reference: Brian Conrad, *Deligne's notes on Nagata compactifications*, Theorem 2.4 and
Remark 2.5.

Conrad states his theorem over an auxiliary base `S`, for a morphism `Y ⟶ S` and a
rational `S`-map from `X` to `Y`; the first step of his proof replaces `Y` by `Y ×_S X`
and thereby reduces to the case `S = X`. Only that reduced form is stated here:

- `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_admissibleBlowup_extend_partialSection`: let `X` be a qcqs
  scheme, `U ≤ V` quasi-compact opens of `X` with `U` dense, and `p : Y ⟶ X` a separated
  quasi-compact morphism locally of finite type with `Y` qcqs. A section `f` of `p` over
  `U` whose image is closed in `p⁻¹(V)` extends, after a `V`-admissible blow-up of `X`,
  to a section of `p` over an open `W` of the blow-up containing the preimage of `U`, and
  the graph of the extension is closed in `Y ×_X X'`
  (blueprint: `thm:nagata-conrad-elimination`, in the form reduced to the base `X`);
- `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_admissibleBlowup_extend_section`: **Conrad's Remark 2.5**, the
  case `V = U`. Here the closed-image hypothesis is automatic: `f` is then a section of
  the separated morphism `p ∣_ U`, hence a closed immersion
  (blueprint: `lemma:nagata-conrad-morphism-is-quasi-domination`).

The first statement is what
`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_admissibleBlowup_isOpenImmersion_strictTransformMap` (Tag 081S)
in `WeilConjectures.Compactification.EliminationOfIndeterminacy` is deduced from; with its
proof here,
that deduction and the Nagata compactification theorem's dependence on it are
unconditional.

## Structure of the proof

The mathematics is in the three files imported here, and the proof below is their
assembly:

1. if `p` is quasi-affine as a morphism, the statement is Conrad's Case 3,
   `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isAdmissible_extend_of_isQuasiAffineHom_of_le`;
2. in general
   `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isAdmissible_locallyQuasiFinite_image_graph` produces a
   `V`-admissible blow-up `q : X̃ ⟶ X` over which the scheme-theoretic image `F(U)‾` of the
   graph `F = (f, σ)` is quasi-finite, of finite type, separated and quasi-compact over
   `X̃`;
3. `AlgebraicGeometry.IsQuasiAffineHom.of_locallyQuasiFinite` (Zariski's Main Theorem)
   turns those four properties into quasi-affineness of `F(U)‾ ⟶ X̃` *as a morphism* —
   neither `X̃` nor `F(U)‾` is quasi-affine as a scheme;
4. `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isAdmissible_extend_partialSection_of_blowup` base changes
   the whole problem along `q`, and
5. `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isAdmissible_extend_partialSection_of_isClosedImmersion`
   replaces the base-changed target `Y ×_X X̃` by the closed subscheme `F(U)‾`, which by
   step 3 is quasi-affine over `X̃`, reducing to step 1.

The two orientations of the fibre product have to be reconciled: step 2 works in
`Y ×_X X̃ = pullback p q` and steps 4 and 5 in `X̃ ×_X Y = pullback q p`. The bridge is
`CategoryTheory.Limits.pullbackSymmetry`, and it is used only through the closed immersion
`F.imageι ≫ (pullbackSymmetry p q).hom`, so that no transport of scheme-theoretic images
along an isomorphism is needed.

/-- **Conrad's Theorem 2.4, reduced to the base `X`** (blueprint:
`thm:nagata-conrad-elimination`, in the form reduced to the base `X`;
`def:nagata-conrad-quasi-domination`).

Conrad's Theorem 2.4 is stated for a rational map over an auxiliary base `S`; the first
step of his proof replaces `Y` by `Y ×_S X`, which is the reduction to the form stated
here. In the vocabulary of the blueprint the hypothesis says that `(U, f)` is a
quasi-domination of `V` over `Y`, and the conclusion that `(W, g)` is a
quasi-domination of the blow-up over `Y` extending `f`.

Elimination of indeterminacy (Stacks Project Tag 081S,
`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_admissibleBlowup_isOpenImmersion_strictTransformMap`) is
deduced from this statement.

Density of `U` is not used: neither Conrad's Case 3 nor the quasi-finiteness of the graph
needs it. The hypothesis is kept because it is part of the interface consumed
downstream. -/

`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_admissibleBlowup_extend_partialSection` (blueprint:
`thm:nagata-conrad-elimination` with `V = U`, together with

No closedness hypothesis is needed: over `U` the morphism `f` is a section of the
separated morphism `p ∣_ U`, hence a closed immersion, so its image is closed in
