# The tensor product of sheaves on an essentially small site preserves colimits

The K-flat left derivability structure requires the sheaf category to interact well with
the coproducts defining the tensor product of complexes and with `ℤ`-indexed colimits. All
of these conditions — `GradedObject.HasTensor₄ObjExt`,
`GradedObject.HasGoodTensor₁₂Tensor`, `GradedObject.HasGoodTensorTensor₂₃` and the
preservation of `ℤ`-indexed colimits in each variable — unfold to the statement that
`tensorLeft X` or `tensorRight X` preserves a colimit of size `0`. This file proves the
single instance they all follow from, for the monoidal structure of
`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.GrothendieckAbelian.Monoidal.Defs`.

The proof is Day's reflection theorem
(`CategoryTheory.Monoidal.Reflective.monoidalClosed`), which makes `Sheaf J A` monoidal
closed and hence `tensorLeft X` a left adjoint. Its inputs are all available for an
arbitrary site `C` with `Hom`-types in the universe `u` and objects in `u + 1` which is
essentially small in `u + 1`, exactly as in the sibling file `Defs`:

* the presheaf category `Cᵒᵖ ⥤ A` is monoidal closed for the objectwise monoidal
  structure, by `CategoryTheory.MonoidalClosed.FunctorCategory.monoidalClosed`, whose
  internal hom is the enriched functor hom. This is a *scoped* instance, hence the
  `open scoped` below. Its enriched-hom side conditions are limits of size `u + 1`,
  supplied by `CategoryTheory.IsGrothendieckAbelian.hasLimits` exactly as for the
  monoidality of `W` in the sibling file `Defs`;
* the presheaf category is *symmetric* monoidal, which is what Day's theorem asks of the
  ambient category and is the only reason `A` is assumed symmetric rather than merely
  braided here — this is the sole extra hypothesis this file adds to those of `Defs`;
* `presheafToSheaf` is monoidal and `sheafToPresheaf` is fully faithful, both instances
  of `CategoryTheory.Sheaf.monoidalCategory`'s file for the monoidal structure of `Defs`.

Note that the resulting `monoidalClosed_sheaf_of_essentiallySmall` is over the monoidal
structure of `Defs` (the sheafification of the objectwise tensor product), *not* over a
cartesian one: mathlib's `instMonoidalClosedSheafOfHasSheafifyOfFunctorOpposite` produces a
monoidal closed structure for the cartesian tensor on a full monoidal subcategory of
presheaves, which is a different instance and moreover unavailable here, since the
coefficient categories of this development are abelian and a non-trivial additive category
is never cartesian closed.

The small étale site and the small pro-étale site are such sites, so the étale and
pro-étale instances at the end of the file are obtained from the general ones by
`inferInstance`.

## Main results

- `CategoryTheory.GrothendieckTopology.monoidalClosed_sheaf_of_essentiallySmall`: the category
  of `A`-valued sheaves on an essentially small site is monoidal closed.
- `CategoryTheory.GrothendieckTopology.preservesColimitsOfSize_tensorLeft_sheaf_of_essentiallySmall`
  and its right variant: tensoring with a fixed sheaf preserves colimits of size `0`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.sheafMonoidalClosed`,
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.preservesColimitsOfSize_tensorLeft_sheaf`: the special cases for
  the small étale site.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.sheafMonoidalClosed`,
  `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.preservesColimitsOfSize_tensorLeft_sheaf`: the special cases
  for the small pro-étale site.

/- The monoidal structure on the coefficient category, as in the sibling file `Defs`,
except that the braiding is strengthened to a symmetry: Day's reflection theorem is

/-- The category of `A`-valued sheaves on an essentially small site is monoidal closed,

This is Day's reflection theorem applied to the sheafification adjunction
`presheafToSheaf ⊣ sheafToPresheaf`: the left adjoint is monoidal, the right adjoint is
fully faithful, and the presheaf category is symmetric monoidal closed. -/

compatibility between the tensor product of sheaves and colimits that the K-flat left
derivability structure asks for. -/
