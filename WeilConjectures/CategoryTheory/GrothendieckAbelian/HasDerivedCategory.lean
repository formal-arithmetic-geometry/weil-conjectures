# The derived category of a Grothendieck abelian category

Let `C` be an abelian category satisfying `IsGrothendieckAbelian.{w} C`. This file
constructs `HasDerivedCategory.{w} C`, i.e. a chosen localization of `CochainComplex C ℤ`
at the quasi-isomorphisms whose `Hom`-types live in `Type w`.

The construction is purely formal from the existence of K-injective resolutions
(`CategoryTheory.Abelian.HasKInjectiveResolutions`, which holds in every Grothendieck
abelian category by
`CategoryTheory.Abelian.hasKInjectiveResolutions_of_isGrothendieckAbelian`):

* the homotopy category of complexes is locally `w`-small because the category of
  complexes is (`HomologicalComplex.locallySmall`) and quotients preserve local smallness;
* the full subcategory `HomotopyCategory.KInjectives C` is therefore locally `w`-small;
* by `HomotopyCategory.KInjectives.Qh.IsEquivalence` (assuming K-injective resolutions),
  it is equivalent to any model of the derived category, so `DerivedCategory C` is
  locally `w`-small;
* finally `MorphismProperty.hasLocalizationOfLocallySmall` shrinks the `Hom`-types of the
  standard derived category to `Type w`.

## Main definitions

* `DerivedCategory.locallySmall`: the derived category of a locally `w`-small abelian
  category with K-injective resolutions is locally `w`-small.
* `HasDerivedCategory.ofHasKInjectiveResolutions`: `HasDerivedCategory.{w} C` from
  `LocallySmall.{w} C` and `HasKInjectiveResolutions C`.
* `HasDerivedCategory.ofIsGrothendieckAbelian`: `HasDerivedCategory.{w} C` from
  `IsGrothendieckAbelian.{w} C`.
