# Tor amplitude is tested on the residue field

Let `C` be a closed braided monoidal Grothendieck abelian category with functorial flat
resolutions, linear over a commutative ring `R` compatibly with the tensor product, and let
`ϖ ∈ R` be nilpotent. Put `κ = 𝟙 / ϖ` (the cokernel of `ϖ` on the unit). Assume that tensoring
with an object killed by `ϖ` preserves monomorphisms between objects killed by `ϖ`: this is
the flatness of all modules over the field `R / ϖ` when `C` is a category of sheaves of
`R`-modules and `R / ϖ` is a field.

Then an object `K` of the derived category `D(C)` has Tor amplitude in `[a, b]` exactly when
`K ⊗ᴸ κ` has homology concentrated in `[a, b]`
(`DerivedCategory.torAmplitudeIn_iff_homologyConcentratedIn_tensor_singleFunctor`).

For `F` killed by `ϖ`, represent `K` by a K-flat complex `P`: then `K ⊗ᴸ F` is `P ⊗ F`, which is
`(P ⊗ κ) ⊗ F` because `κ ⊗ F ≅ F`, and tensoring with `F` preserves the exactness of the
complex `P ⊗ κ` of objects killed by `ϖ`
(`ShortComplex.Exact.map_tensorRight_of_smul_eq_zero`). A general `F` has the finite
filtration by the `ϖ^s F`, whose graded pieces are killed by `ϖ`.

This is the categorical core of blueprint `lem-sf-proetale-residue-tor-test`.

/-- Blueprint `lem-sf-proetale-residue-tor-test`: The residue test on the pro-étale site (the
categorical statement).

Let `r ∈ R` be nilpotent and `κ ≅ 𝟙 / r` the cokernel of `r` on the unit, and assume that
tensoring with an object killed by `r` preserves monomorphisms between objects killed by `r`
(for sheaves of `R`-modules with `R / r` a field: every module over the field `R / r` is flat).
Then `K ∈ D(C)` has Tor amplitude in `[a, b]` if and only if `K ⊗ᴸ κ` has homology concentrated
in `[a, b]`.

One direction is the definition of Tor amplitude. Conversely, for `F` killed by `r` this is
`DerivedCategory.homologyConcentratedIn_tensor_singleFunctor_of_smul_eq_zero`, since
`κ ⊗ F ≅ F` (`CategoryTheory.tensorIsoOfSmulEqZero`); a general `F` is killed by some power
`r ^ m`, and the short exact sequences `0 ⟶ r F ⟶ F ⟶ F / r F ⟶ 0`
(`DerivedCategory.exists_shortExact_of_smul_pow_succ_eq_zero`) give distinguished triangles
