# Functoriality of the rationalization

Let `M` be a submonoid of a commutative ring `R` and `C` an `R`-linear triangulated category.
The morphisms of the rationalization `Rationalization M C` are fractions with denominators in
`M`: every morphism `Q X ⟶ Q Y` becomes of the form `Q f` after multiplication by some `m ∈ M`
(`CategoryTheory.Rationalization.exists_smul_eq_map`), and `Q f = Q g` if and only if
`m • f = m • g` for some `m ∈ M` (`CategoryTheory.Rationalization.map_eq_map_iff`). Both follow
from the observation that a morphism `s` with `M`-torsion mapping cone has an inverse up to
multiplication by an element of `M` (`CategoryTheory.Rationalization.exists_comp_eq_smul_id`).

An `R`-linear triangulated functor `F : C ⥤ D` induces a functor
`CategoryTheory.Rationalization.map M F` between the rationalizations, and this functor is
fully faithful when `F` is (`CategoryTheory.Rationalization.full_map`,
`CategoryTheory.Rationalization.faithful_map`): on `Hom` groups it is the localization at `M`
of the bijection induced by `F`.
