# Composition of total right derived functors

Let `F : C ⥤ D` and `G : D ⥤ E` be additive functors between abelian categories with
K-injective resolutions. This file proves the Grothendieck composition theorem for the
total right derived functors on the unbounded derived categories: if `F` sends
K-injective complexes to K-injective complexes, then the canonical comparison

`R(F ⋙ G) ≅ RF ⋙ RG`

is an isomorphism (`Functor.rightDerivedFunctorCompIso`). The composite `RF ⋙ RG`,
equipped with the composite unit `Functor.rightDerivedFunctorCompUnit`, is itself a right
derived functor of `(F ⋙ G).mapHomotopyCategory ⋙ Qh`: by the K-injective right
derivability structure it suffices to check that the composite unit is an isomorphism on
K-injective complexes, which holds since the unit of `RF` is an isomorphism on K-injective
complexes and the unit of `RG` is an isomorphism on their images under `F`. The
isomorphism then follows from the uniqueness of right derived functors.

The K-injectivity hypothesis is packaged as the type class
`Functor.PreservesKInjectiveComplexes`, for which the main criterion is
`CategoryTheory.Adjunction.preservesKInjectiveComplexes`: a right adjoint of an *exact*
functor preserves K-injective complexes. (For the intended application, the pushforward
`f_*` of étale sheaves is right adjoint to the exact pullback `f^*`, so that the Leray
composition isomorphism `RΓ(Y, Rf_* K) ≅ RΓ(X, K)` becomes an instance of the theorem;
see `Etale.derivedGlobalSectionsComp`.) The proof of the criterion uses the induced
adjunction on categories of homological complexes,
`CategoryTheory.Adjunction.mapHomologicalComplex`, and transport of null-homotopies along
the adjunction.

The file also records the functoriality of the total right derived functor in natural
transformations (`Functor.rightDerivedFunctorNatTrans`,
`Functor.rightDerivedFunctorNatIso`), so that a composition `F ⋙ G ≅ H` of underived
functors yields `RF ⋙ RG ≅ RH` in one step
(`Functor.rightDerivedFunctorCompIso'`).

## Main definitions

  functors and its special case
