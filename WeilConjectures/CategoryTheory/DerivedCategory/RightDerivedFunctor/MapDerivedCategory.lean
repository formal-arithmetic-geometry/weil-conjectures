# The total right derived functor of an exact functor is `mapDerivedCategory`

An exact functor `F : C ⥤ D` between abelian categories induces a functor
`F.mapDerivedCategory : DerivedCategory C ⥤ DerivedCategory D` directly, by applying `F`
levelwise (`Mathlib.Algebra.Homology.DerivedCategory.ExactFunctor`). When the abelian
category `C` moreover has K-injective resolutions, `F` also has a total right derived
functor `F.rightDerivedFunctor` computed via K-injective resolutions
(`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.DerivedCategory.RightDerivedFunctor.Defs`). This file
shows that the two constructions agree:

- `Functor.rightDerivedFunctorIsoMapDerivedCategory`: the canonical isomorphism
  `F.rightDerivedFunctor ≅ F.mapDerivedCategory`, obtained from uniqueness of right
  derived functors: since the comparison `F.mapDerivedCategoryFactorsh` is an
  isomorphism, `F.mapDerivedCategory` is *itself* a right derived functor of
  `F.mapHomotopyCategory ⋙ Qh`.
- `Functor.isIso_rightDerivedFunctorUnit`: consequently, the unit of the right derived
  functor of an exact functor is an isomorphism everywhere (not only on K-injective
  complexes).

From this compatibility we derive, still for exact functors, the isomorphisms expressing
that right derivation commutes with the constructions preserved by `mapDerivedCategory`
(themselves in `WeilConjectures.Mathlib.Algebra.Homology.DerivedCategory.ExactFunctor`:
`Functor.mapDerivedCategoryNatIso`, `Functor.mapDerivedCategoryCompIso` and
`Functor.mapDerivedCategoryHomologyFunctorIso`):

- `Functor.rightDerivedFunctorHomologyFunctorIso` and
  `Functor.singleFunctorCompRightDerivedFunctorIso`: the commutation of the total right
  derived functor with the homology functors and with the single-degree embeddings.
- `Functor.rightDerivedFunctorCompIsoOfExact`: the composition isomorphism
  `R(F ⋙ G) ≅ RF ⋙ RG` for *exact* `F` and `G`. This is the exact-functor counterpart of
  `Functor.rightDerivedFunctorCompIso` of
  `WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.DerivedCategory.RightDerivedFunctor.Comp`, which holds
  for arbitrary additive functors but takes `F.PreservesKInjectiveComplexes` instead of
  exactness.

The functoriality of `rightDerivedFunctor` in natural isomorphisms is *not* repeated
here: `Functor.rightDerivedFunctorNatIso` of
`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.DerivedCategory.RightDerivedFunctor.Comp` already
provides it for arbitrary additive functors.

This is the right-derived counterpart of
`WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.DerivedCategory.LeftDerivedFunctor.MapDerivedCategory`.
Note the asymmetry in the hypotheses: left derivation via K-flat resolutions requires the
source category to carry a monoidal structure with functorial flat resolutions, while
right derivation via K-injective resolutions only requires
`CategoryTheory.Abelian.HasKInjectiveResolutions`.
