# The condensed coefficient rings `ℤ_ℓ`, `ℚ_ℓ`, `𝒪_E`, `E` and `ℚ̄_ℓ`

Fix a prime `ℓ`. The four *topological* `ℓ`-adic coefficient rings are defined as condensed
rings by their sections on profinite sets, following Section 3 of
`WeilConjectures/RefactorInstruction.tex`:
```
ℤ̲_ℓ(S) := C(S, ℤ_ℓ),   ℚ̲_ℓ(S) := C(S, ℚ_ℓ),   𝒪̲_E(S) := C(S, 𝒪_E),   E̲(S) := C(S, E),
```
with restriction by precomposition and the pointwise ring operations: each is
`Profinite.continuousMapRingSheaf` of the corresponding topological ring. Here `E` is a subfield
of `ℚ̄_ℓ = PadicAlgCl ℓ`, given by an embedding `E → ℚ̄_ℓ`, with the topology restricted from
`ℚ̄_ℓ` (`PadicAlgCl.normedFieldOfAlgebra`), and `𝒪_E = PadicAlgCl.integers ℓ E` is its ring of
integers.

The familiar descriptions `ℤ̲_ℓ ≅ lim_n ℤ/ℓⁿ`, `ℚ̲_ℓ ≅ ℤ̲_ℓ[1/ℓ]`, `𝒪̲_E ≅ lim_n 𝒪_E/ϖⁿ` and
`E̲ ≅ 𝒪̲_E[1/ϖ]` are *not* definitions; they are comparison isomorphisms, to be proved later.

The condensed `ℚ̄_ℓ` is not of the form `C(-, T)`. Following Definition 3.6 of the notes, a
section over a profinite set `S` is a continuous map `S → E` into a finite subextension
`E ⊆ ℚ̄_ℓ` of `ℚ_ℓ`, regarded in `ℚ̄_ℓ`: the condensed ring `ℚ̲̄_ℓ` is the subsheaf of
`C(-, ℚ̄_ℓ)` of the maps with values in a finite subextension
(`Profinite.padicAlgClCondensedRing`). The sheaf condition is checked directly: a covering is
refined by a finite jointly surjective family, and finitely many finite subextensions have a
finite compositum. It is *not* `C(-, ℚ̄_ℓ)` for the valuation topology, which has more sections:
a sequence of elements of unbounded degree converging to `0` gives a continuous map on a
convergent sequence that takes values in no finite subextension.

The inclusions `ℤ_ℓ → ℚ_ℓ → E`, `ℤ_ℓ → 𝒪_E → E` are continuous ring homomorphisms, so
postcomposition with them gives morphisms of condensed rings.

## Main definitions

* `Profinite.padicIntCondensedRing`, `Profinite.padicCondensedRing`: the condensed rings
  `ℤ̲_ℓ` and `ℚ̲_ℓ`.
* `Profinite.padicSubfieldCondensedRing`, `Profinite.padicIntegersCondensedRing`: the condensed
  rings `E̲` and `𝒪̲_E`.
* `Profinite.padicIntCondensedRingToPadicCondensedRing`,
  `Profinite.padicCondensedRingToPadicSubfieldCondensedRing`,
  `Profinite.padicIntegersCondensedRingToPadicSubfieldCondensedRing` and
  `Profinite.padicIntCondensedRingToPadicIntegersCondensedRing`: the inclusions, as morphisms of
  condensed rings.
* `Profinite.padicAlgClCondensedRing`: the condensed ring `ℚ̲̄_ℓ`, and
  `Profinite.padicAlgClRingObj`: the underlying ring object of condensed abelian groups.
