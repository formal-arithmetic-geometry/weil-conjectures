# The braiding of the derived tensor product

For a braided Grothendieck abelian category `C` with functorial flat resolutions, this file
names the braiding `DerivedCategory.braidedCategory C` of the derived tensor product on
`DerivedCategory C`, whose existence is `DerivedCategory.nonempty_braidedCategory`: the braiding
of `C`, with the Koszul sign rule on complexes, descended along K-flat resolutions
(`CategoryTheory.DerivedMonoidal.braidedCategory`).

## Implementation notes

`DerivedCategory.braidedCategory` is not an instance, since other braidings of derived categories
are assumed as instances elsewhere (for instance `AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.DerivedBraiding`).
It is meant to be used as a local instance. It is stated for a general `C`: instantiating it at a
concrete sheaf category is cheap, while elaborating `DerivedMonoidal.braidedCategory` directly at
such a category makes the kernel compare two elaborations of the monoidal structure.
