Source: main-20261015 direct-images proof, paragraph (3), formal derived-restriction
infrastructure (blueprint: def-sfb-condensed-derived-invariants).
The source records this auxiliary infrastructure as agent-formulated, with a reference wanted.
No assertion that underived continuous cochains compute derived invariants is made.

/-- The given additive category of internal actions is abelian, for arbitrary topological G.
Source: paragraph (3) (blueprint: def-sfb-condensed-derived-invariants).
Proof: use the action-site presentation and the internal/sectionwise module equivalence.
Kernels and sheafified cokernels carry the induced action; normality and finite products
are computed on underlying internal modules. -/

/-- The action-site presentation transports the generator, colimits and AB5.
Source: paragraph (3) (blueprint: def-sfb-condensed-derived-invariants).
Proof: the action-site module equivalence preserves all limits and colimits; apply the

/-- Forgetting the action creates kernels and cokernels and detects exactness.
Source: paragraph (3) (blueprint: def-sfb-condensed-derived-invariants).
Proof: the equivariance equation restricts to kernels and descends to sheafified cokernels.
The forgetful functor is faithful and detects zero; exactness is therefore detected. -/
