# Constructible sheaves on the small étale site

Let `X` be a scheme and let `F` be a sheaf on the small étale site of `X` (see
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.smallEtaleTopology`) with values in a category `A`. Following
[SGA 4, Exp. IX, §2] we define:

- `F` is *constant* if it is isomorphic to the sheafification of a constant presheaf;
  this is mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Sheaf.IsConstant`.
- `F` is *locally constant* (`IsLocallyConstantSheaf`) if there is an étale cover of `X`
  (a jointly surjective family of étale maps `Uᵢ ⟶ X`, a cover in
  `Scheme.etalePrecoverage`) such that the restriction of `F` to each `Uᵢ` is constant;
  the trivializing data is packaged in `LocallyConstantDatum`. A constant sheaf is
  locally constant, trivialized by the identity cover
  (`CategoryTheory.Sheaf.IsConstant.isLocallyConstantSheaf`).
- `F` is *finite* (`IsFiniteSheaf`) if the stalk of `F` at every geometric point of `X`
  (`Scheme.pointSmallEtale`) is finitely generated
  (`CategoryTheory.ConcreteCategory.IsFinitelyGenerated`): a finitely generated module for
  sheaves of modules, a finite set for sheaves of sets, a finite module over a finite ring.
- `F` is *finite locally constant* (`IsFiniteLocallyConstantSheaf`) if it is locally
  constant and finite.
- `F` is *constructible* (`IsConstructibleSheaf`) if there is a stratification of `X`
  (`Scheme.Stratification`: a stratification of the underlying topological space of `X` —
  a finite partition into constructible locally closed subsets, `Topology.Stratification`,
  following [Stacks 09XZ] and [Stacks 03RW] — together with schemes immersed in `X` realizing
  the strata) such that the pullback of `F` to each stratum is finite locally constant. For
  `X` quasi-compact and quasi-separated this is the affine-local notion of [Stacks 03RW]; in
  general it is stronger, see `IsConstructibleSheaf`.

All four predicates are `Prop`-valued classes.

Following the convention of the `SixFunctors` folder, the coefficient category `A` is a
Grothendieck abelian category with small-site sheafification
(`CategoryTheory.HasSmallSiteSheafify`) and `Hom`-types in the universe `u + 1`, one above
the universe `u` of the base schemes; the class is what supplies the sheafification used
to restrict a sheaf to a member of an étale cover, see the implementation notes. The notions
involving finiteness require `A` to be moreover concrete, finite generation referring to the
elements of the underlying type `CategoryTheory.ToType`. This covers sheaves of abelian groups
(`A = Ab.{u + 1}`) and of `Λ`-modules (`A = ModuleCat.{u + 1} Λ`), for all the coefficient
stages of the `ℓ`-adic formalism: the finite rings `Λₙ = 𝒪_E/ϖⁿ`, the valuation rings `𝒪_E` and
the fields `E` and `ℚ̄_ℓ` (`def-sf-setting`). Over a finite ring a finitely generated module is
finite; over a field it is finite-dimensional, so constructible sheaves over a field are not
forced to vanish.

To restrict `F` to an étale `U ⟶ X` we use the localized site: `F.over U` is the sheaf
induced by `F` on the localization of the small étale site at `U`, which is equivalent to
the small étale site of `U`. To restrict `F` to a stratum we use the pullback
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.upperStar` of `WeilConjectures.SixFunctors.Etale.UpperLowerStar.Defs`
along an immersion, the left adjoint of the pushforward `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.lowerStar`.

## Implementation notes

- The pullback `Etale.upperStar` is defined by left Kan extension along base change
  followed by sheafification. The Kan extensions in question exist for an arbitrary `f`
  without any smallness of the full small étale site, by the instance
  `CategoryTheory.Functor.hasPointwiseLeftKanExtension_of_hasColimitsOfSize` of
  `WeilConjectures.Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Functor.KanExtension.Pointwise`: the indexing comma
  categories have objects in `Type (u + 1)` and `Hom`-types in `Type u`, and `A` has all
  colimits of size `u + 1`.
- Sheafification is likewise not assumed here. Restricting a sheaf to a member of an étale
  cover needs it for the *localizations* of the small étale sites, and for a Grothendieck
  abelian `A` it is supplied by the instance
  `CategoryTheory.GrothendieckTopology.hasSheafify_over_smallEtaleTopology` of
  `WeilConjectures.CategoryTheory.GrothendieckAbelian.HasSheafify`, a slice of an
  essentially small site being again essentially small; it is a case of the sorried
  `CategoryTheory.GrothendieckTopology.hasSheafify_of_essentiallySmall` there. This replaces
  what used to be a `HasWeakSheafify` hypothesis quantified over all schemes and all étale `U`, the
  quantification being forced by the existential quantifier over stratifications.
- Similarly, `CategoryTheory.Sheaf.IsConstant.isLocallyConstantSheaf` assumes the
  existence of the right Kan extensions along `(Over.forget U).op` needed to compare
  sheafification on the small étale site with sheafification on its localizations.

scheme immersed in `X` with set-theoretic image the stratum. A sheaf on the small étale site
of `X` is constructible if its pullbacks to the strata of some stratification are finite
locally constant, see `IsConstructibleSheaf`.

Constructibility of the strata (`Topology.Stratification.isConstructible_stratum`) is part of
the definition of a constructible sheaf [Stacks 03RW, 095E]: without it, on a non-noetherian
quasi-compact `X` with a non-quasi-compact open `U`, the extension by zero of the constant sheaf
on `U` would be constructible, and on `X = Spec ∏ 𝔽₂` the skyscraper sheaf at a closed non-open
point would be. On a noetherian scheme every locally closed subset is constructible, and
`Stratification.ofNoetherianSpace` builds a stratification from locally closed strata alone. -/

/-- A sheaf `F` on the small étale site of `X` with values in a concrete category is
*constructible* if there is a stratification of `X` such that the pullback of `F` to each
stratum is finite locally constant.

The stratification records a choice of scheme structure on each stratum via the immersion
`S.immersion i : S.domain i ⟶ X`; by topological invariance of the small étale site the
condition does not depend on this choice.

The left Kan extensions along base change needed by the pullback `Etale.upperStar` are
provided by the instance
`CategoryTheory.Functor.hasPointwiseLeftKanExtension_of_hasColimitsOfSize` of
`WeilConjectures.Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Functor.KanExtension.Pointwise`. Stating
`IsFiniteLocallyConstantSheaf` needs sheafification for the localizations of the small
étale sites of the strata; since the stratification is existentially quantified, this has
to be available for all schemes, which is what the hypothesis
`CategoryTheory.HasSmallSiteSheafify A` provides (see the module implementation notes).

The strata are constructible subsets (`Topology.Stratification.isConstructible_stratum`), as
in [Stacks 03RW]. Every sheaf constructible in the present sense is constructible in the
affine-local sense of loc. cit.: the traces of the strata on an affine open `U` form a
stratification of `U` (preimages of constructible subsets along morphisms of schemes are
constructible, `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.isConstructible_preimage`). For `X`
quasi-compact and quasi-separated the converse holds, so this global definition agrees with
[Stacks 03RW] and with [Stacks 095E]: the decompositions of the members of a finite affine open
cover, whose members are retrocompact, have a common refinement by constructible locally closed
subsets of `X`. For a general `X` the present definition is stronger: it asks for a single
finite stratification of all of `X`, whereas loc. cit. lets the decomposition depend on the
affine open. For instance let `Λ` be a nonzero coefficient ring, let `X` be the disjoint union
over `n` of the affine spaces `𝔸ⁿ` over a field, each with a flag `𝔸ⁿ = Z₀ ⊃ Z₁ ⊃ ⋯ ⊃ Zₙ` of
irreducible closed subsets, and let `F` be on `𝔸ⁿ` the direct sum of the pushforwards of the
constant sheaf `Λ` from the `Zᵢ`, so that the stalk of `F` at the generic point of `Zᵢ` is
free of rank `i + 1` over `Λ`. A subset of `X` on
which `F` is locally constant cannot contain the generic points of two members of a flag (the
later one is a specialization of the earlier one, so every neighbourhood of it in the subset
contains the earlier one, where the rank differs), so a stratification trivializing `F` has at
least `n + 1` strata meeting `𝔸ⁿ` for every `n`, and there is no finite one; whereas every
affine open of `X` meets finitely many `𝔸ⁿ` and `F` is constructible on it in the sense of
loc. cit. For sheaves of modules over a noetherian ring, the pullbacks to the strata being
locally constant of finite type, it is the constructibility of sheaves of modules of the Stacks
project. In the `ℓ`-adic formalism it is applied with `A = ModuleCat Λ` for the coefficient
stages `Λ` of `def-sf-setting`.

Over a scheme with Noetherian underlying space the constructibility of the strata is automatic,
see `IsConstructibleSheaf.of_noetherianSpace`. -/
