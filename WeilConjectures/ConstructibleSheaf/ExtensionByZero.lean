# Extension by zero and closed pushforward of constructible sheaves

The open–closed dévissage of `WeilConjectures.ConstructibleSheaf.OpenClosed` is phrased for a
complementary pair `(j, i)` of an open and a closed immersion. Here the second member of the
pair is constructed:

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IsConstructibleSheaf.openImmersionLowerShriek_of_quasiCompact`
  (blueprint `lem-fin-extension-by-zero`): the extension by zero `j_! F` of a constructible
  sheaf along a quasi-compact open immersion `j` is constructible; the complement is the closed
  complement `j.closedComplement`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IsConstructibleSheaf.lowerStar_of_isClosedImmersion_of_quasiCompact`
  (blueprint `lem-fin-closed-immersion`, sheaf part): the pushforward `i_* G` of a constructible
  sheaf along a closed immersion `i` with quasi-compact open complement is constructible.

Quasi-compactness of the open immersion (retrocompactness of its range) is needed because
constructible sheaves are defined via stratifications by *constructible* locally closed subsets;
on a non-Noetherian scheme the extension by zero of the constant sheaf along a non-quasi-compact
open immersion is not constructible. It is automatic on a locally Noetherian scheme, where every
open immersion is quasi-compact (an instance of Mathlib), which covers the schemes of finite type
over a field of the blueprint.

Let `j : U ⟶ X` be an open immersion and `F` a constructible sheaf on `U_ét`. Then `j_! F` is
constructible on `X_ét`. The open immersion is assumed quasi-compact, which is automatic on a
locally Noetherian scheme and is needed for the strata of `U` to remain constructible subsets
of `X`, see the module docstring. -/

Let `i : Z ⟶ X` be a closed immersion and `G` a constructible sheaf on `Z_ét`. Then `i_* G` is
constructible on `X_ét`. The open complement of `i` is assumed quasi-compact, which is automatic
on a locally Noetherian scheme, see the module docstring. The vanishing of the higher direct
