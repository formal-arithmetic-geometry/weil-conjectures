/-- The homeomorphisms of the ambient spaces and the embedded subspaces give
compatible equivalences of sheaf categories and of global sections. Only direct
images occur here; no inverse-image adjunction or restriction unit is used.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-embedding-pushforward-transport)

Proof:
1. The homeomorphism e identifies the frames of opens of X and Y. Its order
isomorphism and its inverse preserve covers: a family covers an open precisely
when its union is that open. Precomposition with the opposite open-set functors
therefore carries sheaves to sheaves. The inverse order isomorphism supplies the
inverse functor, and the identities of the two composites supply unit and counit.
Call this equivalence T. The order isomorphism preserves the top open, giving the
natural isomorphism a on global sections.
2. Since i is an embedding, it identifies Z homeomorphically with its range.
Restrict e to D = e inverse-image of range i and compose with the inverse of this
homeomorphism to obtain D homeomorphic to Z. Apply the same open-set construction
to obtain the equivalence S of sheaf categories on Z and D.
3. The square of continuous maps from these two homeomorphisms and i and j
commutes. Taking inverse images of opens makes the corresponding square of
open-set functors commute up to the canonical isomorphism. Precomposition of
presheaves, and then the full inclusion of sheaves, gives the natural isomorphism
r between the direct-image functors. This construction uses no point of any of
the spaces and works unchanged when the image or the ambient space is empty. -/
