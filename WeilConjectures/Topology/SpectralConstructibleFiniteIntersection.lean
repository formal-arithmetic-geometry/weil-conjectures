/-- In a spectral space, a family of constructible subsets with empty intersection
has a finite subfamily with empty intersection.

Source: literature/stacks-project/topology.tex, Topology, Lemma 0901 and the
paragraph before it (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-spectral-constructible-finite-intersection).
Proof: Put the constructible topology on the spectral space. Constructible sets
are closed there, and that topology is quasi-compact. The complements therefore
form an open cover, which has a finite subcover; taking complements gives the
finite subfamily. The empty space is handled by the empty finite subfamily.
