/-- The comparison predicate is closed under coproducts, triangles and retracts.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 0DJA(1), 0BYJ and 09PB.

Proof: the mixed-ring K-flat associator identifies the source comparison for
U tensor_A Q with tensoring the derived base-coefficient comparison by U.
Derived tensor, restriction of scalars and cohomology commute with arbitrary
set-indexed direct sums of module complexes. Scalar extension to C commutes
with sums as a left adjoint. Hence the comparison of a coproduct is a direct
sum of the comparisons of its summands, and is invertible when all of them are.
For a distinguished triangle in D(A), tensor with the A-K-flat Q and then
apply R-to-B derived tensor. This yields the source long exact cohomology
sequence, with its canonical A tensor_R B action. Flatness of C over that ring
makes scalar extension exact, so it preserves this long exact sequence.
The target sequence is obtained by derived tensoring with N over C after
A-to-C scalar extension; K-flat representatives compute this functor. The
mixed associator and naturality of the derived counit give a morphism of these
long exact sequences, including the connecting maps. In every degree the
five lemma makes the third comparison invertible when the first two are.
For a retract, functoriality makes each comparison arrow a retract of the
corresponding comparison arrow for the larger object. A retract of an
isomorphism is an isomorphism. Naturality and invariance under roofs of
K-flat quasi-isomorphisms prove all assertions for every representative and
every model in the definition. Neither the initial comparison for Q nor any
map t is assumed a quasi-isomorphism in this closure assertion. Empty sums,
zero rings, arbitrary unbounded complexes and nonflat A-to-C maps are included.
