/-- A bounded projective complex exact in positive degrees admits a bounded projective
model with zero positive terms and the same homology in every degree.

Source: Stacks Project, More on Algebra, Tag 066Q; explicit tail splitting in
lem-sc-strict-perfect-closed-pushforward-stalk-resolution, step 3.
(blueprint: lem-sc-bounded-projective-nonpositive-model).

Proof. First show that the cycle object in degree j ≥ 0 is projective by downward
induction from an upper bound. At the upper end the outgoing differential is zero,
so cycles equal the term. For the inductive step, vanishing of homology in degree
j+1 makes L^j → Z^(j+1) epic. Split this map using projectivity of Z^(j+1).
The endomorphism 1-fs of L^j factors through Z^j and gives a retraction of its
inclusion; hence Z^j is projective as a retract of the projective term L^j.
Take the good truncation at zero. Its degree-zero term is Z^0, its negative terms
are those of L and its positive terms are zero, so all its terms are projective.
The lower bound min(a,0) works. The inclusion of this truncation into L is a
quasi-isomorphism because the positive homology of L vanishes. Its homology maps
give the required isomorphisms. This realizes the same successive split-epimorphism
argument as positive-tail removal without constructing the contractible summands.
It covers an empty support interval and the zero complex, uses only projectivity,
and chooses no degree-zero target module. -/
