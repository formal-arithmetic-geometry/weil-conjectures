/-- The integer-indexed differentials square to zero and commute with the augmentation.

Source: Stacks Project, Derived Categories, Lemma 05T7 (1).
(blueprint: lem-pc-cycle-pullback-tower-laws-stage3).

Proof: In a successor stage the differential is pi, followed by the second pullback
projection and the inclusion of the kernel of the preceding stage's differential.
Thus its composite with that preceding differential is zero by the kernel equation.
The first projection followed by the target differential equals the second projection
followed by the kernel inclusion and the preceding augmentation, by the pullback
condition. Precompose this equation by pi. For integer degree i below N, the tower
index in degree i+1 is one less than the index in degree i, so the two equations
transport to exactly the displayed equations. At i=N the next terms are zero;
the same calculation uses the initial stage. Above N all differentials and
augmentations are zero, and both equations follow from composition with zero. -/
