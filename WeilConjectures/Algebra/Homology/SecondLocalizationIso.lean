Proof: compute both universal derived functors on an R-K-flat resolution of Q.
Extension along the flat localization B to Bp is exact, so its homology is
extension of B-homology. The ordinary associator identifies the extended
resolution with extension from R to Bp. Its counit square identifies the derived
lift in secondLocalizationDerivedMap with this associator, by uniqueness of
left derived lifts. Thus the cohomology map is the standard flat base change
isomorphism after extension to Bp. Naturality with multiplication by A on Q and
the cohomologyIso_smul equations prove A-linearity; Bp-linearity is built in.
Tensor induction therefore gives linearity over A tensor_R Bp. Tensor
associativity extends this isomorphism to D and supplies the generator formula.
Every localization denominator is a unit in D. No flatness of D is required.
If T contains zero, Bp and D are zero and both extended modules are zero.
Identity localization gives the unique counit-compatible model transport. -/
