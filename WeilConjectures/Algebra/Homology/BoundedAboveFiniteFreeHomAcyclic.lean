/-- The total sheaf Hom from a bounded-above complex with finite free terms to a
bounded-below acyclic complex is acyclic.
Source: Stacks Project, cohomology.tex, Tag 0GM8, case (2)
(blueprint: lem-sc-bounded-above-finite-free-hom-acyclic).

Proof:
1. Choose an upper bound `N` for `E`. For every degree `p`, internal Hom from `E.X p`
   preserves short exact sequences by `lem-sc-finite-free-internal-hom-exact`:
   a finite free basis identifies the internal Homs with finite direct sums.
2. Choose a lower bound `M` for `A`. A degree-`m` cocycle section of the total Hom
   (`def-pur-hom-complex`) has components `z^p : E^p → A^(p+m)` only for
   `M-m ≤ p ≤ N`. Seek a degree-`m-1` section `h` with
   `d_A h^p + (-1)^m h^(p+1) d_E = z^p`. Set `h^p = 0` above `N` and descend.
   At degree `p`, the obstruction `z^p - (-1)^m h^(p+1) d_E` is a cycle: use the
   cocycle equation for `z`, the equation already solved at `p+1`, and `d_E² = 0`.
   Acyclicity identifies cycles with boundaries (`def-pc-acyclic-complex-modules`).
   Step 1 therefore lifts this obstruction through the differential locally on a covering.
   Below `M-m+1`, the target of `h^p` vanishes, so take `h^p = 0`; at the last degree
   the remaining obstruction is zero because the cycles in degree `M` are zero.
   There are only finitely many degrees needing lifts, hence finitely many covering
   refinements. On the final covering, `d(h) = z`. Every cocycle section is locally
   a boundary, so every cohomology sheaf of the total Hom vanishes. -/
