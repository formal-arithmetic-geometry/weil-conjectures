/-! # Composing sheaves of commutative rings with the forgetful functor to rings

The instance `(Opens.grothendieckTopology X).HasSheafCompose (forget₂ CommRingCat RingCat)` is found
by Mathlib's general instances, but when the term `sheafCompose (Opens.grothendieckTopology X)
(forget₂ CommRingCat RingCat)` appears in the statement of a theorem (typically in a hypothesis
`R = (sheafCompose _ (forget₂ CommRingCat RingCat)).obj X.sheaf` for a ringed space `X`), the search
can get stuck on universe constraints and never terminate (Mathlib v4.35.0). This file states the
instance directly for sheaves on a topological space, so that the search succeeds at once.
