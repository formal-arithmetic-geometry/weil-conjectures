# Transport through the coefficient stages

The blueprint builds the Poincaré pairing at the finite stages `A_{E,n} = 𝒪_E/ϖ^n` and
carries it to `𝒪_E`, `E` and `ℚ̄_ℓ` by the uniform-tower reconstruction and by descent along
the common-stage construction. In this repository a coefficient stage is a ring `Λ` with the
category `ModuleCat Λ`, the finite reduction along an ideal `J` is the endofunctor
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.reductionModIdeal` (`K ↦ K ⊗ᴸ (Λ/J)_X`) of `D(X_ét, Λ)`, and the
`𝒪_E` stage is the derived-complete subcategory `DerivedCategory.derivedCompleteIntegral`.
This file states the genuinely new content of `sk-thm-transport` that the API can express.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.isPerfectPairing_poincarePairing_reductionModIdeal`: the derived
  Poincaré pairing of the reduction `K ⊗ᴸ (Λ/J)_X` is perfect, as is that of every complex at a
  finite coefficient ring.

The other ingredients of `sk-thm-transport` are stated where they belong:
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.nonempty_iso_reductionModIdeal_rightDerivedLowerShriek` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.nonempty_iso_reductionModIdeal_rightDerivedLowerStar` identify the two
factors of the reduced pairing with the reductions of the two factors of `β_K`, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.derivedCompleteIntegral_coefficientDual`,
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.derivedCompleteIntegral_rightDerivedLowerShriek` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.derivedCompleteIntegral_rightDerivedLowerStar` place every object of
`β_K` at `Λ = 𝒪_E` in the adic category `D_comp(−, 𝒪_E)`.

The two other nodes of the subsection are proved in their own files:
`prop-pod-integral-degreewise-form` in
`WeilConjectures.EtaleCohomology.PoincareDuality.IntegralDegreewise` (the universal coefficient
sequences `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.shortExact_compactlySupportedReductionSequence`,
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.shortExact_cohomologyReductionSequence`,
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.integralDegreewise_adjoint` and the degreewise duality
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.integralDegreewiseDuality`), and
`thm-pod-adic-reconstruction-and-scalar-extension` in
`WeilConjectures.EtaleCohomology.PoincareDuality.AdicReconstruction` (the adjoint
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.poincareAdjoint`, its reductions and
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.adicReconstruction_scalarExtension`). The third node,
`thm-pod-qbar-coefficient-pairing`, is treated separately.

## Not stated

- *Change of coefficient ring.* The finite stage `A_{E,n}` is read inside `D(X_ét, Λ)` through
  `reductionModIdeal`, and the `A_n`-dual of `RΓ_c(X, K_n)` as `RHom_Λ(RΓ_c(X, K), A_n)`. The
  pairing built over the ring `A_{E,n}` itself, in `D(X_ét, A_{E,n})`, is not compared with the
  reduction of the pairing over `Λ`: this needs the compatibility of `Rf_!`, `Rf_*`, the dual
  and the tensor product with restriction of scalars `derivedRestrictScalars`, which the
  repository does not have.
- *Identification of the transported pairing.* Over `E` and over a finite extension `L ⊇ E`
  the images of the `𝒪_E`-duality isomorphism are isomorphisms
  (`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.adicReconstruction_scalarExtension`); that they are the dualities
  of the base-changed complexes needs the compatibility of the six operations with derived base
  change, which the repository does not have. The transport of the degree-indexing maps, of
  the relative form and of the Frobenius squares is not stated.
- *The `ℚ̄_ℓ` stage.* The colimit over finite `E/ℚ_ℓ` is treated with
  `thm-pod-qbar-coefficient-pairing`.
- *The trace isomorphism and the Frobenius statements.* They are built from the pairing and
  the smooth trace, and transport with them; the Frobenius statements belong to
  `sk-thm-frobenius`.

/-- Blueprint `sk-thm-transport`: Transport through the coefficient stages.

**The duality is compatible with finite reduction.** For an ideal `J` of the finite
coefficient ring `Λ`, a Tate orientation `γ` and `K ∈ D(X_ét, Λ)`, the derived Poincaré pairing
`β_{K ⊗ᴸ (Λ/J)}` of the reduction of `K` is perfect. The reduction of a perfect complex need not
be perfect over `Λ`, so this is not an instance of
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.TateOrientation.isPerfectPairing_poincarePairing` for `K ⊗ᴸ (Λ/J)`
itself; it holds because at a finite coefficient ring the derived Poincaré pairing is perfect
for every complex, the Tate twist being invertible
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.TateOrientation.isPerfectPairing_poincarePairing_of_finite`). -/
