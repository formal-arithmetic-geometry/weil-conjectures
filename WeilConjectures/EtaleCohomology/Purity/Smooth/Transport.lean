# Smooth purity over `𝒪_E`, `E` and `ℚ̄_ℓ`

Smooth purity is proved at the finite coefficient stage in
`WeilConjectures.EtaleCohomology.Purity.Smooth.Basic`. This file records what the three
remaining coefficient stages of the `ℓ`-adic formalism need: the adic category over `𝒪_E`, its
rationalization over `E`, and the colimit over finite extensions `E/ℚ_ℓ` giving `ℚ̄_ℓ`.

In this repository the `𝒪_E` stage is the derived-complete subcategory
`AlgebraicGeometry.DerivedCategory.derivedCompleteIntegral` of the derived category of sheaves
of `𝒪_E`-modules, and the `E` stage is its rationalization
`AlgebraicGeometry.DerivedCategoryDerivedCompleteRational`.

## Implementation notes

The statement here is that `Rf^!` preserves derived completeness, which is what makes the
`𝒪_E` stage a stage at all. The transport of the purity isomorphism itself is in
`WeilConjectures.EtaleCohomology.Purity.Smooth.Reduction` (compatibility with the finite
reductions) and `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.NormalizedTower.exists_iso_of_isHomotopyLimit` (the
realization at the `𝒪_E` stage of a levelwise isomorphism of normalized systems); the smooth
traces are in
`WeilConjectures.EtaleCohomology.Purity.Smooth.Trace`. The purity isomorphism cannot be read
off `sk-thm-smooth-purity` at `Λ = 𝒪_E`: in the étale model `Lf^* K` of a derived complete
`K` need not be derived complete (the constant sheaf `𝒪_E` on `𝔾_m` over an algebraically
closed field is not), whereas `Rf^! K` is.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.derivedCompleteIntegral_rightDerivedUpperShriek`

## Proof

Derived complete objects are those receiving no nonzero map from an object on which a
uniformizer `ϖ` of `𝒪_E` acts invertibly
(`DerivedCategory.derivedComplete_iff_rightOrthogonal`). A map `L ⟶ Rf^! K` is adjoint to a
map `Rf_! L ⟶ K`, and `ϖ` acts invertibly on `Rf_! L` if it does on `L`, since `Rf_!` is
`𝒪_E`-linear.

**`Rf^!` preserves derived completeness.** Let `f : X ⟶ Y` be smooth separated of pure
relative dimension `d` and let `Λ = 𝒪_E` be the integral coefficient stage. Then `Rf^!`
carries derived-complete objects of `D(Y_ét, 𝒪_E)` to derived-complete objects of
`D(X_ét, 𝒪_E)`, so that it restricts to the adic categories `D_comp(−, 𝒪_E)` in which the
`ℓ`-adic formalism is typed. The exceptional inverse image `Rf^!` at the integral stage is the
right adjoint of `Rf_!`, whose existence is assumed here: the instance
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.isLeftAdjoint_rightDerivedLowerShriek` only covers finite coefficients.

The purity isomorphism `γ_{f,K} : Lf^* K(d)[2d] ≅ Rf^! K` at the adic stage, realized from the
finite-level purity isomorphisms, is their realization
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.NormalizedTower.exists_iso_of_isHomotopyLimit`). -/
