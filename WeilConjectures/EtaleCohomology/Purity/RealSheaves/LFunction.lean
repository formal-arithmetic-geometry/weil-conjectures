# Cohomology and the Euler series of a Weil representation

For an abelian sheaf `A` on the small étale site of a scheme `C`, ordinary étale cohomology
`Hⁱ(C, A) = RⁱΓ(C, A)` is Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Sheaf.H` at the Grothendieck topology
`C.smallEtaleTopology`, and cohomology with proper support `H_cⁱ(C, A)` is
`AlgebraicGeometry.Etale.compactlySupportedCohomology`, with scoped notation `H_c(f)[A](i)`.
Neither is redefined here.

What is new in this file is the *Euler series* of a lisse Weil representation `ρ` on a curve
`p : C ⟶ Spec K` over a finite field, relative to an embedding `ι : ℚ̄_ℓ →+* ℂ`:

`L_ι(C₀, ρ, T) = ∏_{x ∈ |C₀|} ι P_x(ρ, T ^ e_x)⁻¹ ∈ 1 + T ℂ⟦X⟧`,

a product over the closed points of `C₀`, where `P_x(ρ, T)` is the local polynomial
`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.localPolynomial` and `e_x = p.degreeOver x` is the residue degree.
The product is locally finite: only finitely many factors contribute to a fixed coefficient,
since there are only finitely many closed points of bounded degree
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.finite_setOf_degreeOver_le`). Accordingly it is taken in the
product topology on `ℂ⟦X⟧`, for which `open scoped PowerSeries.WithPiTopology` supplies the
instances, and `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.multipliable_eulerFactors` records that it really
converges there, so that the `tprod` is not a junk value.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.eulerSeries` : the Euler series `L_ι(C₀, ρ, T)`.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.multipliable_eulerFactors` : the Euler product converges.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.constantCoeff_eulerSeries` : `L_ι(C₀, ρ, T) ∈ 1 + T ℂ⟦X⟧`.

The Euler product converges in the product topology of `ℂ⟦X⟧`: the local factor at `x` is
`1` modulo `T ^ e_x`, and only finitely many closed points have degree below a given bound
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.finite_setOf_degreeOver_le`), so only finitely many factors

The Euler series `L_ι(C₀, ρ, T) = ∏_{x ∈ |C₀|} ι P_x(ρ, T ^ e_x)⁻¹` of a Weil representation
`ρ`, the locally finite product over the closed points `x` of the curve of the inverses of the
local polynomials `P_x(ρ, T)` of `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.localPolynomial`, transported to
`ℂ` along `ι` and substituted into `T ^ e_x` for the residue degree `e_x = p.degreeOver x`.

Each factor is a formal power series with constant term `1`, so the product lies in
`1 + T ℂ⟦X⟧` (`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.constantCoeff_eulerSeries`); it is taken in the
product topology on `ℂ⟦X⟧`, in which it converges by
`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.multipliable_eulerFactors`. -/

The Euler series lies in `1 + T ℂ⟦X⟧`: every local factor has constant term `1`, because the
local polynomial `P_x(ρ, T) = det (1 - T F_x)` does. -/
