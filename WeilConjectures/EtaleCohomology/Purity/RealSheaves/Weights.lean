# Local weights, reality and determinant weights

Let `ρ` be a lisse Weil representation on a curve `C₀ / 𝔽_q` and `ι : ℚ̄_ℓ →+* ℂ` a field
embedding. At a closed point `x` of `C₀` the local Frobenius `F_x` acts on the geometric
stalk, and the local polynomial is `P_x(ρ, T) = det (1 - T F_x)`. The `ι`-weight of a nonzero
local eigenvalue `α` is `2 log |ι α| / log q_x`.

This file defines these notions, punctual `ι`-purity, the bound `weights ≤ w`, `ι`-reality,
and the determinant weight `dw_ι(V) = wt_ι(det V) / rank V`.

The rank `N_γ` and the weight sum `B_γ` of `sk-d-real-detweights` are sums over the family of
irreducible constituents of a semisimple Weil sheaf *counted with multiplicity*; they are defined
in `WeilConjectures.EtaleCohomology.Purity.RealSheaves.DetWeights`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.rankAbove`, `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.weightSumAbove`).

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.frobeniusWeight` : the `ι`-weight `2 log |ι α| / log q_x` of a
  local Frobenius eigenvalue.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.localPolynomial` : `P_x(ρ, T) = det (1 - T F_x)`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.localEigenvalues` : the multiset of local eigenvalues.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.IsPunctuallyPure`, `HasWeightsAtMost`, `IsReal`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.HasDetWeight` : `dw_ι(ρ) = γ`.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.localPolynomial_eq_charpolyRev_of_isConj` : the local
  polynomial only depends on the Frobenius conjugacy class.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.localPolynomial_eq_prod_localEigenvalues` : the local
  polynomial is `∏_α (1 - α T)` over the local eigenvalues.

The local polynomial at `x` is `det (1 - T ρ g ∣ V)` for *every* member `g` of the
Frobenius conjugacy class of degree `e_x` supplied by `x`: a characteristic polynomial is
invariant under conjugation, so the local polynomial of `sk-d-real-weights` is well defined
and is computed by the representation of `sk-i-real-sheaves`. -/

/-- Blueprint `sk-d-real-weights`: Local weights and reality.

The local polynomial is the product `∏_α (1 - α T)` over the local eigenvalues: `ℚ̄_ℓ` is
algebraically closed, so the characteristic polynomial of `F_x` splits as `∏_α (X - α)`, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.localPolynomial` is its reverse. This is what makes the local
eigenvalues the inverse roots of the local polynomial. -/
