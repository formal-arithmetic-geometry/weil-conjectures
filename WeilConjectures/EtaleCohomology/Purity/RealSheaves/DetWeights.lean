# Determinant weights of lisse Weil sheaves

Let `W` be the Weil group of a smooth geometrically connected curve `C₀ / 𝔽_q`, `ℓ ≠ p`, and
`ι : ℚ̄_ℓ →+* ℂ`. The determinant line `det ρ = ⋀^{rank ρ} ρ` of a lisse Weil representation is
a rank-one lisse sheaf, hence punctually `ι`-pure of a unique weight `a` (rank-one purity,
`sk-p-real-rankone`), and the *determinant weight* of `ρ` is `dw_ι(ρ) = a / rank ρ`
(blueprint subsection `sk-d-real-detweights`).

This file defines `dw_ι` (`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.detWeight`) as the weight read off from
the chosen Frobenius lift, `wt_{ι, q}(det ρ(γ)) / rank ρ`, and proves that it is the unique
`a / r` making `det ρ` pure of weight `a`. It then defines the multiset of determinant weights
of the composition factors of a finite-dimensional Weil representation, its rank-counted
version, and the numbers `N_γ` and `B_γ`, and proves that they do not depend on the
composition series (Jordan–Hölder).

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.detWeight`: the determinant weight `dw_ι(ρ)`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.detWeightMultiset`: the determinantal-weight multiset.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.rankDetWeightMultiset`: the rank-counted list.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.rankAbove`, `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.weightSumAbove`:
  `N_γ` and `B_γ`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.weightBlock`: the weight block `𝒮(γ)`.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.existsUnique_isPunctuallyPure_detLine`: the determinant line of
  a lisse Weil sheaf is pure of exactly one weight.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.isPunctuallyPure_detLine_iff_eq_mul_detWeight`: that weight is
  `rank ρ * dw_ι(ρ)`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.hasFiniteGeometricDet_and_detWeight_eq`: `dw_ι` agrees with the
  determinant weight `dw_{λ_ι}` of `sk-d-weights` for the real weight character `λ_ι`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.detWeightMultiset_eq`,
  `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.rankDetWeightMultiset_eq`: independence of the composition series.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.rankAbove_eq_sum`,
  `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.weightSumAbove_eq_sum`,
  `AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.weightBlock_eq_iSup`: the description for a semisimple sheaf.

/-- Blueprint `def-wf-determinantal-weight`: Determinantal weight.

The determinant weight `dw_ι(ρ) = a / r` of a Weil representation `ρ` of rank `r`, where
`a = wt_{ι, q}(det ρ(γ)) = 2 log |ι det ρ(γ)| / log q` for the chosen Frobenius lift `γ` of
degree one. For a lisse `ρ`, `a` is the unique weight of which the determinant line `det ρ` is
punctually `ι`-pure (`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.existsUnique_isPunctuallyPure_detLine` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.WeilGroup.isPunctuallyPure_detLine_iff_eq_mul_detWeight`), which is the
definition of the blueprint; it involves no choice of a coefficient field, the coefficients
being `ℚ̄_ℓ` throughout (compare `lem-wf-determinantal-weight-coefficient-field`). For `V = 0`
it is the junk value `0`. -/
