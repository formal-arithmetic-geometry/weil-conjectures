# Additive equivalences of abelian groups

Variants of `AddEquiv.ofBijective` and of `e.symm ∘ g` stated for morphisms `A →+ B` of abelian
groups. Unlike `AddEquiv.ofBijective` used at a concrete type, the `Add` instances of the
equivalence and of the morphism are compared generically, not by unfolding the group structures,
which keeps the kernel cost low when `A` and `B` are `Ext`-groups.

## Main definitions

- `AddEquiv.ofBijectiveAddMonoidHom`: a bijective morphism of abelian groups, as an additive
  equivalence.
- `AddEquiv.symmComp`: the composite `e⁻¹ ∘ g` of a morphism with the inverse of an equivalence.
