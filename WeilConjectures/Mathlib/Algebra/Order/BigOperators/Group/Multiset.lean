# Two inequalities for sums of multisets in a linearly ordered group

- `Multiset.sum_le_sum_filter_add_of_le`: a sub-multiset `T ≤ M` with one element more than the
  number of elements of `M` above `γ` has sum at most the sum of those elements plus `γ`. This
  is the bound on the weights of the constituents of an exterior power used in
  `sk-p-real-purity`: the largest sum of `N + 1` entries of a list with exactly `N` entries
  above `γ` takes those `N` entries and one entry at most `γ`.
- `Multiset.eq_of_le_of_sum_eq`: if all elements of `s` are at most `γ` and their sum is
  `card s • γ`, all of them equal `γ`.
