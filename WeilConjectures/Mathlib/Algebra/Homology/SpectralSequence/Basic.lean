# Convergence of a first quadrant cohomological spectral sequence

Mathlib knows about spectral sequences (`CategoryTheory.SpectralSequence`) but has no notion of
convergence or of an abutment. This file adds the little that the Grothendieck and
Čech-to-derived spectral sequences need.

For a first quadrant cohomological spectral sequence `E` starting at the `E₂`-page (that is, a
term of `CategoryTheory.E₂CohomologicalSpectralSequenceNat C`) both differentials into and out of
the spot `(p, q)` vanish as soon as `r > max p (q + 1)`, so the objects `(E.page r).X (p, q)`
become constant. `SpectralSequence.pageInfinity` picks out this stable value at the explicit
page `p + q + 2`; no degeneration hypothesis is needed.

`SpectralSequence.Abutment E H` then bundles the data that the image filtration of a first
quadrant double complex produces: a decreasing filtration
`H n = F⁰ ⊇ F¹ ⊇ ⋯ ⊇ Fⁿ ⊇ Fⁿ⁺¹ = 0` of the `n`-th graded piece of the abutment by subobjects,
together with isomorphisms `Fᵖ / Fᵖ⁺¹ ≅ E∞^{p, q}` for `p + q = n`. Since the filtration and
the isomorphisms are genuine data, this is a structure; the `Prop`-valued statement used in the
theorems that consume it is `SpectralSequence.AbutsTo E H`, its `Nonempty`.

## Main definitions

- `CategoryTheory.SpectralSequence.pageInfinity`: the `E∞`-term of a first quadrant
  cohomological spectral sequence, as the stable value of the pages.
- `CategoryTheory.SpectralSequence.Abutment`: a filtration of a graded object exhibiting it as
  the abutment of a first quadrant cohomological spectral sequence.
- `CategoryTheory.SpectralSequence.AbutsTo`: the associated `Prop`.
- `CategoryTheory.SpectralSequence.Abutment.ofIso`: transport of an abutment along isomorphisms
  of graded objects.

/-- The `E∞`-term of a first quadrant cohomological spectral sequence at the spot `(p, q)`.

In the first quadrant both differentials into and out of `(p, q)` vanish on the `r`-th page as
soon as `r > max p (q + 1)`, so the objects `(E.page r).X (p, q)` are canonically isomorphic for
all large `r`; we read off this stable value on the page `p + q + 2`. -/

/-- The data exhibiting the `ℕ`-graded object `H` of `C` as the abutment of the first quadrant
cohomological spectral sequence `E`: a decreasing filtration of each `H n` by subobjects, which
is exhaustive (`F⁰ = ⊤`) and separated in the strong first quadrant sense (`Fⁿ⁺¹ = ⊥`), whose
successive quotients are the `E∞`-terms of total degree `n`. This is the filtration that the
image filtration on the total complex of a first quadrant double complex produces.
