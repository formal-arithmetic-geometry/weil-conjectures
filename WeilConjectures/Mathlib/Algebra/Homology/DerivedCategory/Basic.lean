# The derived category of a zero category

If every object of an abelian category `C` is zero, so is every object of its derived category
(`DerivedCategory.isZero_of_forall_isZero`): every object is the image of a cochain complex,
and a cochain complex of zero objects is zero.

We also record that `DerivedCategory.Q` is the localization at the quasi-isomorphisms
(`DerivedCategory.isLocalization_Q`).

/-- **The derived category is a localization.** For an abelian category `C`, the derived category
`D(C) = DerivedCategory C` is the localization of the category of cochain complexes
`CochainComplex C ℤ` at the quasi-isomorphisms (the morphisms inducing isomorphisms on all
cohomology objects), with localization functor `DerivedCategory.Q`; the universe of its
morphisms is fixed by `HasDerivedCategory.{w} C`.
