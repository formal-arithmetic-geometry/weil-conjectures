# Colimits of presheaves of modules are computed sectionwise

This records, as a single statement, that the category of presheaves of modules over a
presheaf of rings has all small colimits, computed sectionwise, and that the forgetful functor
to presheaves of abelian groups preserves them.

/-- **Colimits of presheaves of modules are sectionwise.** The category of presheaves of
`R`-modules has all small colimits; evaluation at every object `X` preserves them (the sections
of a colimit over `X` are the colimit of the `R(X)`-modules of sections), and so does the
forgetful functor to presheaves of abelian groups.
