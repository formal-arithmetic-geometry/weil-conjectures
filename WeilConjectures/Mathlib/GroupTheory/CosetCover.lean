# Avoiding finitely many proper subspaces

A vector space over an infinite field is not the union of finitely many proper subspaces. This
is `Subspace.exists_eq_top_of_iUnion_eq_univ`, restated for an indexed family of proper
subspaces.

/-- **Avoiding finitely many linear subspaces.** If `k` is an infinite field and
`W₁, …, Wₛ` are proper subspaces of a `k`-vector space `V`, then `V ≠ W₁ ∪ ⋯ ∪ Wₛ`.

Finite-dimensionality of `V`, assumed in the blueprint, is not needed.
