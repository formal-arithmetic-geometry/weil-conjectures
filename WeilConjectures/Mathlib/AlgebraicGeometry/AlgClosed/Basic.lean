# Points of finite schemes over algebraically closed fields

Let `K` be an algebraically closed field. A nonempty finite `K`-scheme has a `K`-point, and
consequently a finite surjective morphism `f : X ⟶ Y` is surjective on `K`-valued points: every
`y : Spec K ⟶ Y` lifts along `f`.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_comp_eq_id_of_isFinite`: a nonempty finite scheme over an
  algebraically closed field `K` has a `K`-point.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_comp_eq_of_isFinite_of_surjective`: a finite surjective morphism is
  surjective on points with values in an algebraically closed field.

/-- Blueprint `lem-sc-finite-nonempty-point`: Finite schemes over algebraically closed fields.

A nonempty finite scheme `X` over an algebraically closed field `K` has a `K`-point: a closed
point of `X` has residue field `K`. -/

/-- Blueprint `lem-sc-finite-flat-surj-points`: Finite flat surjections are surjective on
`K`-points.

Let `f : X ⟶ Y` be finite and surjective and `K` algebraically closed. Then every `K`-point
`y : Spec K ⟶ Y` lifts to a `K`-point of `X`: the fibre `X ×_Y Spec K` is a nonempty finite
`K`-scheme, so it has a `K`-point by `exists_comp_eq_id_of_isFinite`. (Flatness, assumed in the
blueprint, is not needed.) -/

which are dense in every open subset of the Jacobson space `X`. -/
