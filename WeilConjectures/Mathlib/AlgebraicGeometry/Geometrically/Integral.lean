# Composites of morphisms with geometrically integral fibres

A flat morphism with geometrically reduced (resp. integral) fibres followed by a morphism locally
of finite type with geometrically reduced (resp. integral) fibres has geometrically reduced
(resp. integral) fibres. In particular a product of two geometrically integral schemes of finite
type over a field is geometrically integral.
