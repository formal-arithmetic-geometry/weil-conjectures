# Topological Krull dimension: open covers and complements of dense opens

In a quasi-sober `T₀` space, the coheight of a point is bounded by the topological Krull
dimension, and the topological Krull dimension is bounded by any common bound on the
dimensions of the members of an open cover. In an irreducible `T₀` space of dimension at most
one, every point outside a nonempty open subset is closed; if the space is moreover quasi-sober
and noetherian, there are only finitely many such points.

## Main definitions

- `topologicalKrullDimAt`: the local dimension `dim_x X` of a space at a point, the infimum of
  the dimensions of the open neighbourhoods of the point.

## Main statements

- `coheight_le_topologicalKrullDim`: the coheight of a point for the specialization order is
  at most the topological Krull dimension.
- `topologicalKrullDim_le_of_iSup_eq_top`: the topological Krull dimension is at most any
  common bound on the dimensions of the members of an open cover.
- `IsOpen.finite_compl_of_topologicalKrullDim_le_one`: the complement of a nonempty open subset
  is finite.
- `IsOpen.isClosed_singleton_of_mem_compl`: each point of that complement is closed.
- `IsOpen.topologicalKrullDimAt_eq`: the local dimension at a point of an open subset agrees
  with the local dimension in the ambient space.
- `topologicalKrullDim_le_of_specializingMap`, `topologicalKrullDim_le_of_continuous`: comparison
  of the dimensions of two sober spaces along a specializing surjection, respectively along a
  continuous map that is injective on specializations.
- `topologicalKrullDim_lt_of_forall_exists_specializes`: a closed subset all of whose points
  generalize outside it inside a closed `Z` has dimension smaller than `Z`.
- `IsClosed.finite_setOf_maximal_specializes`, `IsClosed.exists_maximal_specializes`: a closed
  subset of a noetherian space has finitely many maximal points, which generalize all its points.
- `exists_specializes_ne_le_topologicalKrullDim_closure`: in a space of dimension at least
  `d + 1`, a proper specialization of the generic point whose closure has dimension at least `d`.
- `exists_le_topologicalKrullDim_closure_singleton`: in a space of dimension at least `d`, a
  point whose closure has dimension at least `d`.
- `Topology.IsEmbedding.topologicalKrullDim_eq_range`: an embedding preserves dimension onto its
  range.
