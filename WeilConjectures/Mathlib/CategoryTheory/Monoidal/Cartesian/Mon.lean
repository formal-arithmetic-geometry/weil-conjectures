# Products and powers of morphisms of monoid objects

In a cartesian monoidal category, the morphisms `M ⟶ N` into a monoid object form a monoid
(`CategoryTheory.MonObj.Hom.monoid`). If `N` is commutative, the morphisms of monoid objects
form a submonoid: the unit is a morphism of monoid objects, and so are products and powers of
morphisms of monoid objects. In particular the `n`-th power `𝟙 M ^ n` of the identity of a
commutative monoid object, the "multiplication by `n`" map, is a morphism of monoid objects.

## Main statements

- `CategoryTheory.MonObj.isMonHom_pow`: a power of a morphism of monoid objects into a
  commutative monoid object is a morphism of monoid objects.
- `CategoryTheory.MonObj.id_pow_comp_id_pow`: `𝟙 M ^ m ≫ 𝟙 M ^ n = 𝟙 M ^ (m * n)`.

A power `f ^ n` of a morphism of monoid objects into a commutative monoid object is a morphism
of monoid objects. Applied to `f = 𝟙 M` this says that the `n`-fold product `𝟙 M ^ n`, which
on `X`-points is `x ↦ x ^ n` (`CategoryTheory.MonObj.comp_pow`), is a homomorphism. -/
