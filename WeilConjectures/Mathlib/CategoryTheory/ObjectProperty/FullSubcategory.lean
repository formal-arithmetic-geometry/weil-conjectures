# Functors between full subcategories

A functor `F : C ⥤ D` which sends the objects satisfying `P` to objects satisfying `Q` induces
a functor `P.liftFullSubcategory Q F h : P.FullSubcategory ⥤ Q.FullSubcategory`. It agrees
with `Q.lift (P.ι ⋙ F) _`, but its value at `X` is `⟨F.obj X.obj, _⟩` on the nose: no
composite `(P.ι ⋙ F).obj X` has to be unfolded when typechecking terms built from it, which
the kernel can find expensive when `F` is a large definition.
