# Limits of sheaves and exactness of sheafification

Finite limits of presheaves are computed objectwise, the inclusion of sheaves into presheaves
preserves limits, and sheafification is exact.

/-- **Finite limits of presheaves are objectwise.** For a category `A` with finite limits:
(1) every evaluation functor `G ↦ G(V)` on `A`-valued presheaves preserves finite limits, and a
functor into presheaves preserves finite limits as soon as all its composites with the
evaluations do; (2) the inclusion of sheaves into presheaves preserves finite limits; (3) when
sheafification exists, the counit of the sheafification adjunction is an isomorphism at every
sheaf. (blueprint: `lem-weil-pbc-presheaf-finite-limits-objectwise`) -/

/-- **Sheafification is exact.** The inclusion of sheaves into presheaves preserves all limits
(limits of sheaves are computed sectionwise, e.g. kernels), and sheafification preserves finite
limits and, being a left adjoint, all colimits. Applied to `A = Ab` this is the exactness of
sheafification of abelian presheaves. (blueprint: `lem-weil-pbc-sheafification-exact`) -/
