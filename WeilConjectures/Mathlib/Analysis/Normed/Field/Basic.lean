# Roots of unity have norm one

In a normed division ring, a root of unity has norm `1`, since the norm is multiplicative.
This generalizes `Complex.norm_eq_one_of_pow_eq_one`.

/-- Blueprint `lem-tw-root-of-unity-modulus`: Modulus of a root of unity.

A root of unity in a normed division ring has norm `1`: `‖ζ‖ ^ n = ‖ζ ^ n‖ = 1`. Applied to
`ℚ̄_ℓ` and to the image of `ζ` under a field embedding `ι : ℚ̄_ℓ → ℂ` this gives both halves of
the blueprint lemma. -/
