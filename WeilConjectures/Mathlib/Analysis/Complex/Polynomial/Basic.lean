# Reduced fractions of complex polynomials

Two facts about a quotient `A / B` of complex polynomials with constant term `1`, used to read
off the local factors of an `L`-function from the `L`-function itself:

- if the reciprocal roots of `A` and those of `B` lie on disjoint sets of radii, then `A` and
  `B` are coprime, so `A / B` is already reduced and its poles are the reciprocal roots of `B`;
- if `A` and `B` are coprime and `A / B` has real coefficients, so have `A` and `B`.

## Main statements

- `Polynomial.map_conj_eq_self_of_isCoprime`: blueprint `lem-zl-real-reduced-factors`.

/-- **Separation by root radii.** Let `A` and `B` be nonzero complex polynomials. If every root
`z` of `A` has `‖z‖⁻¹ ≤ R` and every root `z` of `B` has `‖z‖⁻¹ = S` with `R < S`, then `A` and
`B` are coprime. For `A` and `B` with constant term `1` the numbers `z⁻¹` are their reciprocal
roots, so this says that no reciprocal root of `B` cancels in the fraction `A / B`: its
reciprocal poles of modulus `S` are exactly the reciprocal roots of `B`, with multiplicity
(blueprint: `lem-zl-root-radius-separation`). -/
