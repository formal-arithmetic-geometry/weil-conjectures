# Étale algebras over reduced rings are reduced

Since an étale algebra is Zariski locally standard étale
(`Algebra.IsEtaleAt.exists_isStandardEtale`), and a standard étale algebra over a reduced ring
is reduced (`StandardEtalePair.isReduced_ring`), an étale algebra over a reduced ring is
reduced.

## Main statements

- `Algebra.Etale.isReduced`: an étale algebra over a reduced ring is reduced.

/-- An étale algebra `A` over a reduced ring `R` is reduced. The annihilator of a nilpotent
`x ∈ A` is the unit ideal: every prime `Q` of `A` has a basic open neighbourhood `D(f)` with
`A[1/f]` standard étale over `R`, hence reduced, so `x` vanishes in `A[1/f]` and some `fⁿ ∉ Q`
kills `x`. This is a special case of [Stacks 033B]. -/
