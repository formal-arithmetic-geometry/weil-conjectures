# Square Jacobian presentations

A square Jacobian presentation of an `R`-algebra `S` is a presentation
`S = R[x₁, …, xₘ] / (f₁, …, fₘ)` with as many relations as variables, whose Jacobian
determinant `det (∂fᵢ / ∂xⱼ)` is a unit in `S`. It is a submersive presentation whose
relations and variables are indexed by the same type, the relation `fᵢ` being paired with the
variable `xᵢ`.

/-- A square Jacobian presentation of the `R`-algebra `S` (blueprint
`def-exc-jacobian-presentation`): a presentation `S = R[xᵢ : i ∈ ι] / (fᵢ : i ∈ ι)` such that
the full Jacobian determinant `det (∂fᵢ / ∂xⱼ)` is a unit in `S`. It is recorded as a submersive
presentation with relations indexed by `ι` whose relation `fᵢ` is paired with the variable
`xᵢ`, so that the Jacobian of the submersive presentation is the full Jacobian determinant. -/
