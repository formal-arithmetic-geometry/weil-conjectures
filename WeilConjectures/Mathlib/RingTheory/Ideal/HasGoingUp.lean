# Krull dimension along an integral extension

An injective integral ring extension `R → S` preserves the Krull dimension: contracting a strict
chain of primes of `S` gives a strict chain of primes of `R` (incomparability), and a chain of
primes of `R` lifts to `S` by lying over and going up.

## Main statements

- `ringKrullDim_le_of_isIntegral`: `dim S ≤ dim R` for an integral extension.
- `ringKrullDim_eq_of_isIntegral`: `dim R = dim S` for an injective integral extension.

/-- An injective integral extension `R → S` preserves the Krull dimension:
`dim S = dim R` (Stacks `00OK`). Incomparability bounds `dim S ≤ dim R`, and lying over together
with going up lifts every chain of primes of `R` to `S`.
