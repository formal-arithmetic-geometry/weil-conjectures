# Generators of a tensor product of algebras

## Main results

- `Algebra.TensorProduct.closure_range_tmul_eq_top` — if `A` is generated as a ring by a family
  `a` containing `1` and `B` is generated as a ring by a family `b` containing `1`, then
  `A ⊗[R] B` is generated as a ring by the products `a i ⊗ₜ b j`.

/-- If the family `a` generates `A` as a ring and the family `b` generates `B` as a ring, and
both families take the value `1`, then the elementary tensors `a i ⊗ₜ b j` generate `A ⊗[R] B`
as a ring. -/
