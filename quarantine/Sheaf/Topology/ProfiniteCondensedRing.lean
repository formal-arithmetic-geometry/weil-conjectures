# Arbitrary condensed rings in the profinite-site universe convention

Source: the blueprint, condensed rings and the tensor-abelian ring-object convention;
Hemo--Richarz--Scholbach, Section 3 (blueprint: sk-def-sfb-condensed-ring).

The existing continuous-function, adic and subfield constructions are publicly reexported.
The abbreviation also admits condensed rings not presented by a topological ring.

/-- A condensed ring is a ring object of abelian sheaves on the coherent profinite site,
equivalently a sheaf of rings. Multiplication is tensor multiplication, with integer unit.
The public imports retain the existing continuous-function sheaves, continuous-map
postcomposition, adic rings, subfields and valuation subrings. This abbreviation adds
only the general input type that those constructions inhabit.
