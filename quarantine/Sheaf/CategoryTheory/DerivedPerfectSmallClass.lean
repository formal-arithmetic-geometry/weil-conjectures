/-- Every small family in D(A) lies in an essentially small replete triangulated
perfect class, with bounded-subcoproduct factorization for its own objects.

Source: Neeman, *On the derived category of sheaves on a manifold*, Theorem 0.2;
Krause, *Localization theory for triangulated categories*, Sections 6.2-6.3 and
Proposition 6.8.1.
(blueprint: lem-sfb-derived-perfect-small-class)

Proof: choose v-small representatives P₀ of P. Neeman's Theorem 0.2 makes D(A)
well generated. Its proof presents D(A) as D(R)/Loc(L) for a set of complexes L,
using Gabriel-Popescu; the module derived category is compactly generated and
localization by a set is well generated. By Krause Section 6.3, every object is
beta-compact for some regular beta and D(A) is alpha-well generated for every
sufficiently large regular alpha. Bound the set of cardinals for P₀ by a common
uncountable regular alpha above a well-generation bound for D(A).

Take S = D(A)^alpha, the class of alpha-compact objects. This class is essentially
v-small, replete, triangulated, and contains P₀ and hence P. Section 6.3 and
Proposition 6.8.1 show that it is perfect: componentwise surjectivity on Hom from
all its objects remains surjective after every v-small coproduct. It is also
alpha-localizing and all its objects are alpha-small. Therefore a map from U in S
to a coproduct of objects Y_i in S factors through a subcoproduct indexed by a
subset J of I with cardinality less than alpha. This subcoproduct lies in S by
alpha-localizing closure. Take a:J to I to be the inclusion and g the factorization;
the displayed Sigma.desc is exactly the subcoproduct inclusion. Every cardinal,
skeleton, Hom set, and index here is in universe v. No localizing subcategory Q
or cohomological functor enters this ambient assertion.
