# Models of finite type over the trait

A nearby-cycles model `M` of `X` with special fibre `X'` (a `k'`-scheme) is a *model of finite type
over the trait* `S = Spec k'⟦t⟧`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.ProEtale.CondensedRing.NearbyCyclesModel.IsTraitModel`)
if its total space is separated and of finite type over `S`, and `j` and `i` are the inclusions of
the geometric generic fibre and of the special fibre. For these models nearby cycles are the
geometric nearby cycles of SGA 7 XIII, and Deligne's finiteness theorem applies.
