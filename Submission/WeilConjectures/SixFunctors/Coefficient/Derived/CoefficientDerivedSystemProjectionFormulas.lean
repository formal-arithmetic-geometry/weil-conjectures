/-- Gamma has the actual finite mapping-limit projections and the specified H-zero action.
This is an identity for any calculus with the two recorded projection-model equations,
rather than a new choice
of a mapping equivalence or a construction of the calculus itself.

node lem-coef-derived-system-evaluation-calculus, step 5, final projection calculation
(blueprint: lem-coef-derived-system-projection-formulas).

Proof:
1. Use the actual quotient ring sequence, completed coefficient sheaf and the strict
   system equivalence. Transport the calculus's reduction adjunction, finite evaluations,
   tensors, internal-Hom fibers and sections comparisons to the generic sequence-site
   notation of EnrichedSequenceProjection. The pure-tensor model normalizations identify
   the transported finite tensor comparisons with its normalized scalar comparisons.
   S.unit_projection is its unit condition and S.reductionTensor_evaluation is its
   tensor condition. S.reduction_normalized supplies the first normalized input.
2. Apply enrichedSequenceProjectionFormula. Its finite uncurrying equality says that
   the enriched adjunct followed by the nth total-limit projection and the Hom-fiber
   identification is the scalar adjunct of reduced evaluation followed by the evaluated
   counit. The scalar and closed Hom bijections are injective. Consequently that map
   equals the finite scalar enriched map after Hom of coefficientSequenceProjection,
   with the S.reductionEvaluation transport in its first input.
3. Transport the theorem's right-derived sections and limit pairs to the specified
   coefficient functors. Their universal comparison units determine the transports.
   D.globalLimit_model identifies the transported global comparison with S.globalLimit;
   D.globalEvaluation_model identifies the finite map with S.globalEvaluation, and
   D.scalarSections_model identifies the scalar sections map. Thus the generic global
   projection formula is CoefficientGammaProjection for the actual S.gamma.
   H.sections_projection fixes the system-sections projection used in this transport;
   arbitrary evaluation isomorphisms without this equation would not suffice.
4. Apply H-zero to this equality. The coefficientHomZeroEquiv normalizations identify
   Hom of the total-limit projection with postcomposition by that projection. The
   normalized scalar adjunction takes h to its scalar extension followed by the
   finite counit. This is also the last clause of enrichedSequenceProjectionFormula;
   the ordinary and derived section normalizations in D fix its H-zero transports.
   Rewrite the finite counit by S.counit_projection and naturality of
   S.reductionEvaluation. This yields exactly CoefficientHomProjection for the composite
   coefficientGammaZeroMap; no unrelated Hom equivalence is substituted.
The argument applies to the empty scheme, the zero object and every positive coefficient
level. It never asserts that evaluation preserves K-injective systems, or that reducing
an integral mapping complex computes finite internal Hom. -/
