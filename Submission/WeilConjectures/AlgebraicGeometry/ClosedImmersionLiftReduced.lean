# Lifting morphisms from reduced schemes through closed immersions

A morphism `g : Y ⟶ Z` from a reduced scheme whose image lies in the image of a closed immersion
`f : X ⟶ Z` factors through `f` (`AlgebraicGeometry.ker_le_ker_of_isReduced`, to be used with
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsClosedImmersion.lift`): the kernel of `g` is the vanishing ideal of the
closure of its image, which contains the kernel of `f`.
