/-- Restrict the canonical stalk condition and its coefficient map to a source open.
There is no affineness, quasi-coherence, quasi-compactness or boundedness assumption.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0DJ8, proof that condition (1) is local on X';
Tag 0DJ9, the similarly constructed comparison on U and its inverse image.
(blueprint: lem-pc-single-complex-open-stalk-condition).

Proof: The projection pullback.fst is the base change of the open immersion U.ι,
hence is itself an open immersion. Take an original coordinate presentation c
using nonempty_coordinates. Restrict c.P and c.N termwise along these two
open immersions. Restriction is exact and preserves K-flatness. Its exact derived
functor agrees with derived pullback, so the restrictions of c.e and c.e' give
the representative isomorphisms. The canonical underived tensor-pullback
composition comparison transports the restriction of c.t to the required chain
map. The universal derived counits and their composition compatibility transport
c.represents to its required localization equation; the counit is invertible on
the restricted K-flat representative. These data construct cU. At a point z of
the pullback, the local rings
of U and of the pullback identify with those of X and X' at their images. The
maps from the base stalk rings are unchanged. Open restriction is exact and
commutes with cohomology; the pullback composition comparisons identify the
restricted coefficient map with the original coefficient map on these stalks.
Using K-flat representatives, the base tensor comparison and its tensor-stalk
identification therefore agree under these ring and complex isomorphisms.
The cohomology map in cU is therefore conjugate, through local-ring scalar
extension equivalences, to the cohomology map in c at the image point. Such
conjugation preserves and reflects invertibility, giving equivalence of invertibility
at each z and degree. The original condition gives invertibility in c, hence in
cU. For any other restricted coordinate presentation d, apply the existing
isIso_stalkComparison_iff_coordinates to cU and d in the restricted square. This
gives the required invertibility for every restricted presentation. The assertion
is vacuous for an empty source open, and the
same construction applies to the top open; neither case requires an extra assumption. -/
