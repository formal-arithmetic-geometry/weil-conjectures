/-- Fixed-degree projective Serre vanishing, split from the affine restriction theorem.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 01YS (4), proof by descending induction.
(blueprint: lem-pc-c2-closed-immersion-fixed-degree-vanishing)

Proof: projective space over A and its closed subscheme X are locally Noetherian.
Thus the quasi-coherent finitely presented F is coherent, as is its pushforward G.
The standard N+1 affine opens give H^j(G)=0 for j>N. Descend from that bound,
for all coherent modules G simultaneously. Choose a surjection from a finite
sum of twists O(a) onto G; its kernel K is coherent. Tensor the kernel sequence
with the invertible O(t), preserving exactness. For t at least every -a, the
positive-degree cohomology of the finite sum vanishes by the projective twist
calculation. The induction hypothesis kills H^(j+1)(K(t)) for all sufficiently
large t. The long exact sequence therefore kills H^j(G(t)) for such t.
Apply this at j=q and replace the resulting integer threshold by its maximum
with zero. The projection formula identifies G(t) with i_*(F tensor i^*O(t));
closed immersions are affine, so their cohomology comparison identifies its
cohomology with that on X. This proves the required natural-number threshold. -/
