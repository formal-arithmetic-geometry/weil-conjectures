/-- The closed point of an affine presentation of a strict henselization maps to the
selected geometric point. This is the backward half of the singleton-fibre theorem.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-strict-henselization-closed-fiber-backward)
Proof: give Ω the algebra structure induced by the geometric-point residue map.
The existing strictHenselizationResidue theorem supplies a local-ring structure on the
coordinate-ring colimit C and says that its closed point maps to s(closedPoint Ω).
Every point of a local spectrum specializes to its closed point. Apply this in C to
e(closedPoint A), and in A to e.inv(closedPoint C), then map the latter specialization
by e.hom. The inverse identity gives specializations in both directions. Since Spec C
is T0, e(closedPoint A) = closedPoint C. Substitute in the structural-image equation. -/
