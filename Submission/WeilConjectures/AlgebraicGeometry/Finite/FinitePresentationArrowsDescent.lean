/-- Finitely many arrows between specified finite-presentation models descend to one stage.
Different arrows may have different sources and targets. The equations retain their original
limit arrows, rather than only their isomorphism classes.

Source: Stacks Project, Limits, Tag 01ZM, clause (2), with common refinement.
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-presentation-arrows-descent)

Proof: Descend each arrow by 01ZM(2). Choose a common lower bound of their finitely many
stages. Pullback maps from this common stage to each arrow's stage precompose the descended
arrows. Their equations over the base and compatibility at the limit follow by pullback
projection identities and cone naturality. Empty arrow families are permitted.
