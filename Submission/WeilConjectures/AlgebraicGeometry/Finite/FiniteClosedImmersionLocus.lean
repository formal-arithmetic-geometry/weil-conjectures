/-- A finite morphism is a closed immersion over an open containing every open
closed-immersion locus of an arbitrary base change.

Source: Stacks Project, Morphisms, Tags 04DG and 056J; the marked-open paragraph of
Tag 0GK7. (blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-closed-immersion-locus)

Proof: A closed-immersion fibre spreads to a neighbourhood by the finite-cokernel
and Nakayama argument of 04DG. The set of such fibres is consequently open: every
point of that neighbourhood has a closed-immersion fibre, using the restriction
square and descent along the extension of residue fields. Let W be this set.
The restriction to W has closed-immersion fibres, hence is locally on its target
a closed immersion by the same neighbourhood theorem, and these local assertions
glue. For x in W₀, the closed immersion over W₀ has a closed-immersion fibre.
Descend this first through W₀ → X₀ and then through the given cartesian square.
Descent here is only along field extensions, which are faithfully flat; the
original base change a is arbitrary. Empty opens and empty fibres cause no exception.
