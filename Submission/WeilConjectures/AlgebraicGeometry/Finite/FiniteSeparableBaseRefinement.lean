/-- A morphism to a finite separable extension is smooth, H-projective and proper if its
composite to the original field is smooth and H-projective.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-finite-separable-base-refinement).

Proof:
1. Set `a : Spec L ⟶ Spec k` to be induced by the algebra map and `f = q ≫ a`.
   The map `a` is etale by lem-weil-pbc-finite-separable-extension-etale and separated by
   lem-weil-pbc-affine-source-morphism-separated.
2. Form `W = Z ×[Spec k] Spec L` (def-pc-fibre-product). Its projection `r` to `Z` is
   etale by lem-weil-pbc-etale-scheme-base-change. The graph `(id, q)` is a section of `r`,
   hence an open immersion by lem-weil-pbc-etale-section-clopen-immersion; only this
   clause of the section lemma is needed.
3. The projection `b : W ⟶ Spec L` is smooth by lem-pc-proper-base-change, clause (2).
   Composing with the graph gives smoothness of `q` by
   lem-pc-open-immersion-smooth-composition.
4. Choose an embedding of `Z` into projective space over `Spec k` with a finite type of
   homogeneous coordinates, witnessing def-kun-projective. By
   lemma-nagata-projective-space-base-change-pullback, its graph with `q` maps into
   projective space over `Spec L` with the same coordinate type.
5. The projection from that space to projective space over `Spec k` is separated by
   lem-weil-pbc-separated-base-change. Its composite with the graph is the original
   closed immersion. By lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersion-cancellation the graph is a
   closed immersion too, proving H-projectivity of `q` by def-kun-projective.
6. Apply the already proved upstream instance `IsHProjective.isProper`
   (lem-pc-projective-proper) to obtain properness of `q`. -/
