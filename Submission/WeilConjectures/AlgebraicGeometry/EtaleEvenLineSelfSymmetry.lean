/-- An even shifted rank-one line has identity self symmetry.
Source: blueprint latest, thm-amb-p1-adjunction.proof.md, second triangle,
last paragraph on even shifts; Stacks Tag 06YU.
(auxiliary; not a blueprint node).

Proof: trivialize the sheaf line on an etale cover. The existing etale evaluation
inverse makes the line flat. Braiding naturality identifies its ordinary
self-braiding with that of the tensor unit on each slice. Ordinary sheaf pullbacks
are jointly faithful, so this self-braiding is identity globally. For a single
complex in an even degree n, the only nonzero tensor summand has bidegree (n,n).
The explicit Koszul formula there is the ordinary self-braiding multiplied by
(-1)^(n*n), which is one. The single complex is K-flat; compatibility of the
canonical derived braiding with the invertible localization tensor comparison
therefore gives identity self-braiding for its derived image. Finally, the canonical
single/shift isomorphism identifies J[2d] with the derived single in degree -2d,
and braiding naturality transports the result to shiftedLine. This uses local
faithfulness only for ordinary sheaf maps, never for arbitrary derived morphisms. -/
