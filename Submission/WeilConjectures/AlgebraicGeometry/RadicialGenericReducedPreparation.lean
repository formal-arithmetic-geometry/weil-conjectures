/-- Construct an affine radicial model with reduced source and geometrically reduced
 generic fibre; flatness and finite presentation are deferred to a subsequent shrinking.

Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0559, second proof, reductions through the finite purely
inseparable extension; Tags 051T and 052A.
Proof: the nonempty generic fibre implies that the generic point belongs to V. Factor
through V and reduce source and base. Reduction preserves geometric fibre spaces, and
an irreducible reduced base is integral. Apply generic flat finite presentation and
shrink to a principal open, whose inverse image in the affine source is affine. The
reduced flat source embeds in its generic fibre, a domain. Let K be the base fraction
field and L the fraction field of the generic fibre. A finite purely inseparable K'/K
makes the reduced tensor product of L with K' separably generated. For each generator
b with b^q=a/d, replace b by db, whose q-th power is a*d^(q-1). Adjoin these scaled
generators to the base ring. This finite integral radicial domain has fraction field
K'; its spectrum is a universal homeomorphism. Base change the source and reduce it.
The generic fibre ring embeds in the resulting separably generated field, and hence
is geometrically reduced. The new source remains affine and locally of finite type,
since the quotient map is a closed immersion of affine schemes. Reduction and the
radicial base change preserve geometric irreducibility of each fibre, including empty
fibres. The composite base universal homeomorphism uniquely lifts the generic point.
No final flatness or finite presentation of this reduced base change is asserted.
In characteristic zero use K'=K. No arbitrary witness is used to define an object.
