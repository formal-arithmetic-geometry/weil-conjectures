/-- The explicitly constructed attachment operators compose contravariantly.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0DAV, final paragraph of lemma-hypercovering-object;
expanded by steps 3 and 4 of lem-weil-pbc-site-hypercover-finite-extension.

Proof: Work in normalized coordinates in the old degrees. An old summand has label
`(r,σ,i)` and normalization component `e_(σ,i)`. Factor the composite of an ordinal
operator and `σ` uniquely into its image epimorphism `ρ` and inclusion `τ`. On a new
summand use the prescribed compatible cone `p` for the proper image inclusion; on
an old summand use the old functor. Normalize the resulting old index and compose
its label with `ρ`. This describes `attachmentMap` in all four old/top cases.
For two successive operators, factor the second one through the image of the first.
Both routes have the same image inclusion and concatenated epimorphism. Functoriality
of `K`, or naturality of `p` on a new summand, identifies their unnormalized maps.
The intervening component isomorphism and its inverse cancel, and the bijectivity
of old label normalization identifies their indices. The full-image top case is the
identity endomorphism and requires no factorization. Morphism extensionality of
formal coproducts then proves the equality. This works without finite limits,
finiteness assumptions, or a matching universal property. -/
