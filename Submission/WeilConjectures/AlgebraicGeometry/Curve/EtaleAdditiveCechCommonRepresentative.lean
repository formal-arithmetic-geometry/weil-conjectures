/-- Every global resolution cycle has a common total-complex class with a coefficient cycle.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 03P2, the separated affine-cover comparison, and Tag 01FD,
the two augmentations of the injective Čech double complex.
(blueprint: new-w2-additive-cech-common-representative)

Proof: Restrictions to open subschemes preserve injectives, so the augmented Čech
rows of each resolution term are exact for the covering U. Hence alpha is a
quasi-isomorphism. On each finite intersection, the additive structure sheaf has
vanishing positive cohomology by affine quasi-coherent acyclicity. Consequently
beta is a quasi-isomorphism by the first-quadrant double-complex comparison.
The coordinate identification by restrictFunctorΓ and the additive universe lift
identifies its source with the ordinary unit Čech complex. Alpha sends s to a
cycle tα. Surjectivity of beta on homology gives a coefficient homology class
with image [tα]. Lift this class to a coefficient cycle z, and apply beta to get
tβ. The chain-map identities give the two cycle equations, and the chosen
class gives [tα]=[tβ]. At degree zero the same argument is the augmented kernel
calculation; an empty covering covers only the empty scheme and all groups are
zero. No normalized equivalence or scalar action on sheaf cohomology is used. -/
