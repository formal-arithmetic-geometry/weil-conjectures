/-- The singleton projection admits the signed insertion contraction.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 02FU, insertion cancellation, with the increasing
convention of Tag 01FM.
(blueprint: lem-pc-s3-alternating-cech-sheaf-singleton-contraction).

Proof: On a test open V contained in U i, project degree zero onto the singleton i.
Since V intersect U i equals V, this gives a map to G on V. In all other degrees
use zero. For an increasing tuple not containing i, insert i in its unique
increasing position b and take the corresponding
coordinate with sign (-1)^b; for a tuple already containing i, use zero. Intersection
with U i does not change the test-open intersection, giving a canonical linear map.
These maps commute with restrictions. In the differential-insertion sum, deletion
of the inserted i contributes the identity, while every other deletion pairs with
insertion after deletion, with identical restriction and opposite sign. For tuples
containing i, only deleting that i contributes. In degree zero the remaining term
is singleton projection followed by augmentation. Restriction and module
sheafification commute by the canonical local
sheafification identification: the same compatible germs and their local gluing
compute both sides. Thus sheafify these natural linear maps on the restricted
site; additivity retains the equations. The sheafification
unit on G is inverse to the counit, so the augmented degree-zero term agrees with
the specified augmentation. Transport the nonnegative-degree maps across extendXIso. The degree-zero
equation includes the singleton projection and augmentation. In positive degrees
the two insertion terms sum to the identity; no equation in negative degree and
no adjustment to an arbitrary retraction is asserted here. Empty test opens have
zero modules; r=0 admits no i. -/
