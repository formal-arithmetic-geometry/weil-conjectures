/-- Quotient compatibility for an algebraic strict henselization of `R_q`, with `f ∈ q`.
Let `p` be the image of `q` in `R ⧸ (f)`, i.e. the prime with `p.comap (mk (f)) = q`
(this forces `f ∈ q`). Then `C ⧸ (b f)`, with the `(R ⧸ (f))_p`-algebra structure
induced by `b` (the hypothesis `hcomp`), is the strict henselization of `(R ⧸ (f))_p` with
respect to any separable closure `L` of its residue field.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 05WS, with localization of quotients.

Proof: Set A = R_q and I = f A. Since
p.comap = q, the quotient localization theorem gives the canonical ring isomorphism
A/I = (R/(f))_p, sending the class of r/s to the fraction of the classes of r and s.
The composite π : A → (R/(f))_p is surjective with kernel I. The compatibility hbase
identifies IC with (b(f)), and hcomp says the given action on C/(b f) is induced by π.
Tag 05WS (`IsStrictHenselization.surjective_quotient`) concludes. This works for f = 0
as well; no regularity, Noetherianity, or nonzerodivisor hypothesis enters. -/
