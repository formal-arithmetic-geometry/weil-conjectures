# Regularity of the separating chart of the blow-up

Let `D : BlowupChartData f g h x₀ y₀ c` be the separating chart of the blow-up of a regular local
ring `R`, `Z = Spec (R[T]/(xT - y))[1/f']` with `x = x₀ + c i y₀`, and `h'` the equation of the
strict transform of `H` on `Z`. We show:

* `AlgebraicGeometry.BlowupChartData.isRegularRing_localization`: `Z` is regular;
* `AlgebraicGeometry.BlowupChartData.not_isField_quotient_x`: the exceptional divisor
  `Y = V(x) ⊆ Z` is not a point, if the residue field of `R` is infinite;
* `AlgebraicGeometry.BlowupChartData.isWeaklyRegular`: `(x, h')` is a regular sequence on `Z`.
