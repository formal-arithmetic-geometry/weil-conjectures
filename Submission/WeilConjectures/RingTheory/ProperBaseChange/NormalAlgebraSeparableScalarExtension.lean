/-- A normal commutative `k`-algebra remains normal after a separable field extension `K/k`.
Separability means that every finitely generated intermediate field is separably generated.
Normality means that every prime localization is an integrally closed domain.
There is no algebraicity, finite-generation, domain or nonzero assumption on the algebra.

(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-normal-algebra-separable-scalar-extension).

Proof:
1. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-separable-field-geometrically-normal` to `K/k`. Its separability
   hypothesis is precisely `IsSeparableExtension k K`, not algebraic separability. Thus
   `K` is geometrically normal: `K ⊗[k] E` is normal for every field extension `E/k`.
2. Apply `lem-weil-pbc-geometrically-normal-tensor-normal` with `A = K` and the given `B`.
   Step 1 and the normality hypothesis on `B` give normality of `K ⊗[k] B`.
3. Swap the tensor factors by the balanced map `c ⊗ b ↦ b ⊗ c`. Its reverse is inverse
   on pure tensors, so the universal property and generation by pure tensors of
   `def-weil-pbc-module-tensor-product` give inverse maps. The tensor multiplication and
   unit formulas make these ring maps. The resulting ring isomorphism identifies primes
   and their localizations, sending `x/s` to `f(x)/f(s)`. It preserves domains and
   integral closedness: the induced fraction-field isomorphism preserves monic equations
   and their roots. Hence every prime localization of `B ⊗[k] K` is an integrally closed
   domain, as required by `def-weil-pbc-normal-ring`. If `B` is zero there are no primes;
   disconnected normal rings are covered prime by prime.
