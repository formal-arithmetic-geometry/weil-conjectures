/-- Base change of pointed etale algebras along a surjective local map is final.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 05WS; pointed-colimit proof as recorded in
lem-sbc-strict-henselization-surjective-quotient.
(blueprint: lem-sbc-pointed-etale-quotient-final)

Proof: The residue-field map induced by π is an isomorphism. Transport the
separable closures across it and identify H(K) with L, where H is extension of
scalars. Apply H to each pointed algebra S -> K and compose with this comparison;
etaleness is stable under base change. This constructs F. Its underlying algebra
diagram is definitionally H applied to the original diagram.

The coefficient-lift theorem produces an etale lift of every underlying target
algebra. The bijection on maps into K supplies its compatible point, so every
comma category (T down F) is nonempty. For two comma objects, choose a common
source successor using filteredness. Equalize their induced arrows in the target,
which is also filtered. Lift that equalizing etale morphism relative to its source
algebra using the same coefficient-lift construction. Its reduction isomorphism
produces a common successor in the comma category. Thus the two objects are
linked by a two-arrow zigzag. The connected-comma criterion gives finality.
No strict henselization C or colimit hypothesis is used. -/
