# Regular systems of parameters of a regular local surface

Let `R` be a regular local ring of dimension `2` and `(u, v)` a regular system of parameters,
i.e. `𝔪 = (u, v)`. Then `R/(u)` is a domain on which `v` is a non-zero-divisor, and for
`h ∈ 𝔪 ∖ 𝔪²` the quotient `R/(h)` is a regular ring. We deduce the two facts about tangent
directions used to construct the separating chart of the blow-up:

* a generic line `x₀ + c y₀ = 0` is not tangent to a curve `V(r)`
  (`BlowupChart.not_mem_span_sup_pow_of_eval_ne_zero`);
* if the tangent cones of `V(f)` and `V(g)` meet only at the origin, the dehomogenized initial
  forms of `f` and `g` have no common root (`BlowupChart.not_eval_mem_and_eval_mem`).
