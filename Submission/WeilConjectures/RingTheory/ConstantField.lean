# The constant field of an integrally closed domain

Let `A` be an integrally closed domain containing a field `k`. The *constant field* of `A` over
`k` is the integral closure `k'` of `k` in `A`; it is a field
(`Subalgebra.isField_integralClosure`). It is integrally closed in the fraction field `K` of `A`,
so for every separable algebraic extension `L` of `k'` the ring `A ⊗[k'] L` is a domain
(`Algebra.TensorProduct.isDomain_integralClosure_tensorProduct`): it embeds into `K ⊗[k'] L`,
which is a domain by `Algebra.TensorProduct.isDomain_of_isSeparable`.

Geometrically: a normal integral affine scheme is geometrically irreducible over its constant
field.
