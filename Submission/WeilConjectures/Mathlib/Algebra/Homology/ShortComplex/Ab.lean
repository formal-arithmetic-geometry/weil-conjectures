# The cohomology of a cochain complex of abelian groups

The cohomology `Hⁿ⁺¹(C)` of an `ℕ`-indexed cochain complex `C` of abelian groups is the explicit
quotient of the cocycles `ker(Cⁿ⁺¹ ⟶ Cⁿ⁺²)` by the coboundaries, the class of a cycle being the
class of its underlying element (`CochainComplex.abHomologySuccAddEquiv_homologyπ`).

A short complex (or a homological complex) in an abelian category is exact as soon as its images
under all the functors `Hom(a, -)` are exact
(`CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.exact_of_forall_exact_map_preadditiveCoyoneda`).
