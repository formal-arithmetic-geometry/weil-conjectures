# The isomorphism locus of the unit of a triangulated adjunction

For an adjunction `F ⊣ G` of pretriangulated categories whose left adjoint `F` is triangulated,
the objects at which the unit `X ⟶ G (F X)` is an isomorphism form a triangulated subcategory:
`G` carries the shift structure making the adjunction compatible with the shifts
(`CategoryTheory.Adjunction.rightAdjointCommShift`), for which it is triangulated
(`CategoryTheory.Adjunction.isTriangulated_rightAdjoint`), and the unit is then a natural
transformation of triangulated functors compatible with the shifts.
