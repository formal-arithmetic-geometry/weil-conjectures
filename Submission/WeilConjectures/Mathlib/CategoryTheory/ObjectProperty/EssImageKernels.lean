# The essential image of a full exact functor is closed under kernels and cokernels

Let `F : C ⥤ D` be a full additive functor between abelian categories. If `F` preserves finite
limits, its essential image is closed under kernels; if it preserves finite colimits, it is
closed under cokernels. Indeed a morphism between objects of the essential image is, up to
isomorphism, `F.map g`, whose kernel is `F.obj (kernel g)`.
