# Recognizing the triangle of a recollement

Let `F₁ : C ⥤ D₁` and `F₂ : C ⥤ D₂` be triangulated functors between pretriangulated categories
which jointly reflect isomorphisms (for instance the restrictions `j^*` and `i^*` to an open
subscheme and its closed complement). Two composable morphisms `f : A ⟶ M` and `g : M ⟶ N` with
`f ≫ g = 0` such that `F₁ f` is an isomorphism and `F₁ N = 0`, while `F₂ A = 0` and `F₂ g` is an
isomorphism, extend to a distinguished triangle `A ⟶ M ⟶ N ⟶ A⟦1⟧`
(`CategoryTheory.Pretriangulated.exists_distTriang_of_jointlyReflectIsomorphisms`): the
cone of `f` maps to `N`, and this comparison is inverted by `F₁` and by `F₂`.

This is how the open–closed triangle `j_! j^* K ⟶ K ⟶ i_* i^* K ⟶` is obtained from the
counit of `j_! ⊣ j^*` and the unit of `i^* ⊣ i_*`.

/-- **The triangle of a recollement.** Let `F₁` and `F₂` be triangulated functors jointly
reflecting isomorphisms, and `f : A ⟶ M`, `g : M ⟶ N` with `f ≫ g = 0`, such that `F₁ f` is an
isomorphism, `F₁ N = 0`, `F₂ A = 0` and `F₂ g` is an isomorphism. Then `f` and `g` extend to a
distinguished triangle `A ⟶ M ⟶ N ⟶ A⟦1⟧`.

Proof: complete `f` to a distinguished triangle `A ⟶ M ⟶ P ⟶ A⟦1⟧`. Since `f ≫ g = 0`, the map
`g` factors through `P` by a comparison `φ : P ⟶ N`:

```
  A ──f──▶ M ──g'──▶ P ──h──▶ A⟦1⟧
  ‖        ‖         │φ        ‖
  A ──f──▶ M ──g───▶ N ─────▶ A⟦1⟧
```

`F₁ φ` is a map between zero objects (`F₁ P = 0` as `F₁ f` is an isomorphism), and `F₂ φ` is an
isomorphism (`F₂ g'` is one as `F₂ A = 0`, and `F₂ g' ≫ F₂ φ = F₂ g`). So `φ` is an isomorphism,
and the bottom row, with `δ = φ⁻¹ ≫ h`, is distinguished. -/
