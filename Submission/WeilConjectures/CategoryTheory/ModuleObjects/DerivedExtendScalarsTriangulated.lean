# The derived extension of scalars is triangulated

For a morphism `φ : R ⟶ S` of commutative monoid objects in a Grothendieck abelian closed
symmetric monoidal category, the derived extension of scalars `L(Ext_φ)` is left adjoint to the
restriction of scalars `D(Res_φ)` on the derived categories
(`CategoryTheory.Mod.derivedExtendMapDerivedCategoryAdjunction`). The restriction of scalars is
exact, so `D(Res_φ)` is triangulated; this file equips `L(Ext_φ)` with the commutation with the
shifts for which the adjunction commutes with the shifts
(`CategoryTheory.Mod.commShift_leftDerivedExtendScalars`), for which `L(Ext_φ)` is triangulated
(`CategoryTheory.Mod.isTriangulated_leftDerivedExtendScalars`), as the left adjoint of a
triangulated functor.
