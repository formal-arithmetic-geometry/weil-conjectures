/-- An exact coproduct-preserving functor out of the unbounded derived category of a
Grothendieck abelian category has a right adjoint.
Source: Stacks Project, Tag 0F5Y, `injectives-proposition-brown`.
(auxiliary; not a blueprint node)

Proof in words: for each target object Y, the additive functor
H(W) = Hom(F(W), Y) is cohomological by exactness and takes coproducts to products.
The Grothendieck Brown argument represents H as follows. Present the abelian
category by the Gabriel-Popescu exact localization L from modules over a ring R.
Its derived right adjoint RG is fully faithful and L RG is the identity. The
functor H L is represented by a module complex E, by Brown representability for
the compact generator R. In the triangle M → E → RG(L(E)) → M[1], L(M) = 0,
so Hom(M, E) = H(L(M)) = 0. Thus E → RG(L(E)) is a split monomorphism.
Via the localization adjunction, H is consequently a natural direct summand of
Hom(-, L(E)). The derived category is idempotent complete, so this summand is
represented. Finally Yoneda assembles the representing objects for all Y into a
functor and the natural representing bijections give the right adjunction.
This is the argument of Tags 0F5X and 0F5Y; no compact-generation assertion for
D(A) is used.
