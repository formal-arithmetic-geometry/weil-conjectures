# Dévissage along an invertible annihilator

Let `G` be an object of an abelian category killed by a positive integer `n`, and let `p` be a
prime dividing `n`. The short exact sequence `0 ⟶ ker (p • 𝟙 G) ⟶ G ⟶ coim (p • 𝟙 G) ⟶ 0` has
its kernel killed by `p` and its coimage killed by `n / p`. By induction on `n`, a property `P`
which is stable under extensions and holds for zero objects and for objects killed by a prime
holds for every object killed by `n`. This variant restricts to a class `L` of objects stable
under these kernels and coimages, and only asks for primes `p` which are invertible in a ring
`R` in which `n` is invertible.

## Main statements

- `CategoryTheory.Abelian.nsmul_id_coimage_eq_zero`: if `G` is killed by `p * m`, then the
  coimage of `p • 𝟙 G` is killed by `m`.
- `CategoryTheory.Abelian.prop_of_nsmul_id_eq_zero_of_isUnit`: the dévissage.

/-- **Dévissage along an invertible annihilator.** Let `L` be a class of objects stable under
`G ↦ ker (p • 𝟙 G)` and `G ↦ coim (p • 𝟙 G)`, and let `P` be a property which holds for zero
objects, is stable under extensions, and holds for the objects of `L` killed by a prime `p`
invertible in `R`. Then `P` holds for every object of `L` killed by a positive integer `n`
invertible in `R`.

Proof: induction on `n`. For `n = 1` the object is zero. Otherwise choose a prime `p ∣ n` and
write `n = p * m`; both `p` and `m` are invertible in `R`. In the short exact sequence
`0 ⟶ ker (p • 𝟙 G) ⟶ G ⟶ coim (p • 𝟙 G) ⟶ 0` the kernel is killed by `p` and the coimage by
`m < n` (`CategoryTheory.Abelian.nsmul_id_coimage_eq_zero`). -/
