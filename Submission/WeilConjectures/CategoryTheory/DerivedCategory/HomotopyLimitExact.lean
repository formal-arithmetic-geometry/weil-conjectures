# Exact functors preserve derived limits of towers

`CategoryTheory.Functor.isHomotopyLimit_mapDerivedCategory_mapCone`: an exact functor between
abelian categories with exact countable products, which preserves countable products, sends
homotopy limit cones in the derived category to homotopy limit cones: `F.mapDerivedCategory` is
triangulated and preserves countable products
(`CategoryTheory.Functor.preservesLimitsOfShape_discrete_mapDerivedCategory`).

/-- **Exact functors preserving countable products preserve derived limits of towers**: the
induced functor on derived categories is triangulated and preserves countable products, so it
sends Milnor triangles to Milnor triangles. -/
