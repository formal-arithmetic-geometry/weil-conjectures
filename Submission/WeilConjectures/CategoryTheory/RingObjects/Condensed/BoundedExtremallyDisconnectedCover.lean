/-- Every profinite space admits an extremally disconnected profinite cover with the stated
cardinal bound. Source: Stacks Project, Topology, Tags 090D and 090E
(blueprint: lem-weil-pbc-bounded-extremally-disconnected-cover).

Proof plan:
1. Take the ultrafilters on the underlying set of `X`, with the compact Hausdorff topology
and clopen membership basis of `lem-weil-pbc-ultrafilter-compact-hausdorff-basis`.
The principal ultrafilter at `s` belongs to the basic set `[A]` exactly when `s ∈ A`.
2. Extend the identity set map to `X` by `lem-weil-pbc-ultrafilter-continuous-extension`.
The extension is continuous and sends the principal ultrafilter at `s` to `s`, hence is onto.
3. For an open set `O`, put `A = {s | pure s ∈ O}`. The membership basis gives `O ⊆ [A]`.
Every basic neighbourhood of a point of `[A]` contains a principal ultrafilter in `O`,
since the intersection of its defining set with `A` belongs to a proper ultrafilter.
Thus the closure of `O` is `[A]`, which is open, proving extremal disconnectedness.
4. Distinct ultrafilters are separated by a clopen membership set. Therefore any connected
subset has at most one point, proving total disconnectedness and hence profiniteness.
5. An ultrafilter is a family of subsets, so the underlying set embeds in the double power
set of `X`. An injection of `X` into a set of cardinal `κ` induces injections of power sets
and then double power sets, yielding the bound `2 ^ (2 ^ κ)`. For empty `X` there are no
ultrafilters, and the same construction and estimate apply. -/
