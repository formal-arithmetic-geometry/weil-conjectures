# Closing a goal by a definitionally equal hypothesis, kernel-friendly

`transport_exact h` closes the goal by `h` when the type of `h` and the goal are definitionally
equal but spelled differently (for instance objects of a full subcategory against their ambient
forms, inside large composites of derived functors). The kernel may unfold such large terms in
the wrong order and run out of heartbeats on `exact h`, even though each pair of differing
subterms is definitionally equal in milliseconds.

As in `Mathlib.Tactic.FirstOrderApply.transport`, `h` is transported along a congruence proof of
`HEq A B` built along the common structure of its type `A` and the goal `B`, whose leaves are
closed by `HEq.refl` and are small; the proof is then added as an auxiliary theorem
(`Mathlib.Tactic.FirstOrderApply.sealProof`). The difference is in the descent: two applications
with the same head are compared argument by argument as soon as each pair of explicit arguments
is plausibly equal (`Mathlib.Tactic.FirstOrderApply.plausibleEq`) *or* definitionally equal
within a small heartbeat budget. This keeps the leaves small when an explicit argument is an
object spelled in two ways (e.g. `α.app E` against `α.app E'`), where `HEq.refl` on the whole
application would make the kernel unfold `α`.
