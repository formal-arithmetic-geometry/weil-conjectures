# Compactifiable morphisms to locally noetherian schemes are quasi-compact

A compactification `X ⟶[i] Z ⟶[g] Y` of `f : X ⟶ Y` exhibits `X` as an open subscheme of a
scheme `Z` proper (in particular locally of finite type) over `Y`. If `Y` is locally noetherian,
then so is `Z`, and an open immersion into a locally noetherian scheme is quasi-compact
(Stacks, Tag 01OX). Hence `f = i ≫ g` is quasi-compact.

## Main statements

- `AlgebraicGeometry.HasCompactification.quasiCompact`: a compactifiable morphism to a locally
  noetherian scheme is quasi-compact.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.HasCompactification.quasiCompact_of_locallyOfFiniteType`: a compactifiable
  morphism to a scheme locally of finite type over a field is quasi-compact.
