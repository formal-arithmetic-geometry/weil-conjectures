/-- The localized tensor comparison predicate is closed under retracts.
Source: Stacks Project, Tags 0DJA(1), 0BYJ and 09PB.

Proof: Fix a degree i. The universal derived counit, the canonical tensor associator
and scalar-extension adjunction identify the displayed comparison for a K-flat
representative U with a natural degree-i comparison on D(A). The counit fixes
this map, so changing the derived model conjugates it by canonical isomorphisms.
K-flat quasi-isomorphisms and their roofs give the same conjugation for a change
of representative. Extension from A to C sends A-K-flat complexes to C-K-flat
complexes: tensoring an acyclic C-complex with C tensor_A U is restriction of
that complex tensored over A with U. Thus the target is computed by derived
tensor with N even when A to C is not flat.
Apply the source and target degree-i functors to the inclusion X to Y and
retraction Y to X. They still compose to identities. Naturality makes the
comparison arrow of X a retract, in the arrow category of C-modules, of that
of Y. If a is the latter comparison and b the former, an inverse of b is
the target inclusion followed by the inverse of a followed by the source
retraction. The two naturality squares and the retract identities show that
both composites are identities. Thus b is an isomorphism whenever a is.
Transport through the identifications above proves the assertion for all
K-flat representatives, all models and all degrees. This argument includes
zero objects and identity retracts; no invertibility of t is assumed.
