/-- The three-term short complexes of the graded cone and translated row cone agree.
Source: Stacks Project, Homology, Lemma 12.25.4 (Tag 0133), second-variable variant;
explicit cone refinement in lem-sc-finite-strip-cone-filtration, step 3.
(blueprint: lem-sc-finite-strip-cone-filtration-graded-point)

Proof: Evaluation of cochain complexes preserves cokernels, so evaluate the
cokernel defining the graded piece degreewise. In degree m, quotient the vertical
tail p by the tail p+1. The diagonal
coproduct leaves only K^(m-p,p), together with A.X p when m=p-1. The diagonal
projections induce inverse maps on the quotient: all other summands factor
through the next tail and vanish. To check the inverse on the quotient, cancel
its epic cokernel projection and check on the source and supported diagonal
inclusions generating the step. The p diagonal gives the identity; every larger
vertical index factors through step p+1 and gives zero. The vertical differential
increases its vertical index and therefore vanishes in the quotient. The
horizontal total sign is one. The negative source differential also increases
the vertical index and vanishes; the surviving augmentation block is a p.
The single-complex identifications and hf
identify these blocks with the row cone. Apply these degreewise isomorphisms
at m=n-1,n,n+1. The component differential formulas give the two commuting
squares, hence an isomorphism of short complexes. Zero summands outside the
strip and the single complex are handled by their unique maps, including r=0.
